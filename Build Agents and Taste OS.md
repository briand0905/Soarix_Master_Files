# SOARIX — COMPLETE MASTER SYSTEM DOCUMENT  
### (Creative Layer + Multi-Agent System + TasteOS + ADK + LangGraph Integration)

---

# 1. OVERVIEW

Soarix is a fully agentic app-building system that creates production-ready apps, beautiful frontends, and automated deployments using:

- TasteOS (creative brain)
- Multi-Agent System (Emotion, Aesthetic, Motion, Reviewer, Anti-Template, Layout, UI Builder, Code Builder)
- ADK Execution Engine (safe file writing + real-world actions)
- LangGraph (agent orchestration skeleton)
- Autogen (agent reasoning loops)
- Monitoring Layer (post-deploy intelligence)
- Client Interaction + Feedback Engine  
- Lifecycle & Auto-Update Engine

This document unifies everything.

# 3. CREATIVE LAYER: TASTEOS (SUMMARY)

TasteOS is the “design memory” of Soarix.  
It has 9 subsystems:

- `rules/` → emotion, aesthetic, motion, layout, spacing, typography, anti-template, storytelling, accessibility  
- `tokens/` → spacing, colors, typography, radius, shadows, elevation, motion  
- `images/` → training references  
- `motion/` → GIF/MP4 animation references  
- `components/` → hero, cards, navbars, forms, etc  
- `patterns/` → landing pages, dashboards, onboarding, blog layouts  
- `tags/` → taxonomy (emotion/aesthetic/layout/motion/palette/component)  
- `index/` → master index + changes.log  
- `archives/` → versioning

Agents read TasteOS before making any decision.

# 4. MULTI-AGENT REASONING LOOP (FINAL)

### Step-by-step:

1. Planner Agent → breaks task  
2. Emotion Agent → sets mood  
3. Aesthetic Agent → sets spacing, hierarchy  
4. Motion Agent → sets transitions  
5. Layout Agent → maps patterns  
6. Anti-Template Agent → checks originality  
7. Reviewer Agent → validates rules  
8. UI Builder → converts blueprint → component specs  
9. Code Builder → turns specs → real React/Next.js code  
10. ADK → writes files, builds, generates preview  
11. Monitoring Agents → track app performance

---

# 5. UI BLUEPRINTS (FINAL SPEC)

Each page becomes a single JSON blueprint containing:

- Emotion  
- Aesthetics  
- Layout structure  
- Motion  
- Palette  
- Component Assembly

This is the “creative answer” before any code is written.

---

# 6. CODEGEN LAYER SUMMARY

Transforms:

Blueprint → Tokens → Component Specs → Real React/Tailwind Code

Guarantees:

- No hallucinated HTML  
- No disallowed layout  
- No unsafe code  
- Full responsiveness  
- SEO metadata  
- Motion safety  
- Clean folder structure  

Output passes to ADK.

---

# 7. ADK EXECUTION LAYER (ENGINEERING ENGINE)

ADK:

- Writes files safely  
- Runs CodeGen scripts  
- Handles motion wrappers  
- Creates pages/components  
- Generates previews  
- Interacts with storage, APIs, and infra  
- Manages retry logic  
- Creates deployable bundles  

Safety:

- No shell commands  
- No OS access  
- Only whitelisted operations  
- Rate-limited APIs  
- Network access denied unless approved  

This is the backbone of Soarix builds.

---

# 8. FEEDBACK ENGINE (CLIENT-FACING)

Flow:

1. User gives prompt  
2. Creative Agents generate blueprint  
3. ADK generates preview  
4. Client comments  
5. Revision Agent updates blueprint  
6. Reviewer approves  
7. Code finalizes  
8. Deployment Agent exports final build

This creates a human-friendly loop.

---

# 9. LIFECYCLE ENGINE (AUTO-UPDATE SYSTEM)

Whenever TasteOS changes:

- Detect change  
- Impact analysis  
- Regenerate specs  
- Rebuild with ADK  
- Validate  
- Publish new version  

Apps stay fresh forever.
