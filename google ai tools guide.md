## USER:
I want you to act as my personal tutor and guide me step-by-step in learning all of Google’s AI and developer tools.  
Your job is to teach me how to use the following platforms in a clear, simple, beginner-friendly way:

• Google Gemini (all model families)  
• Google AI Studio  
• Google Labs (ImageFX, MusicFX, Whisk, etc.)  
• Flow (Google’s AI workflow and agent builder)  
• Jules (AI persona builder)  
• Stitch – Design with AI  
• Firebase and Firebase Studio  
• NotebookLM  
• Vertex AI (optional advanced section)  
• Colab / Jupyter Notebooks  
• Opal [Experiment]  
• Google Search & Learn About integrations  
• Google Vids  
• Any other connected Google Cloud services required for production  

Teaching style:  
Simple explanations, real examples, one feature at a time, hands-on exercises, connecting tools to real production systems.

Your goal:  
By the end, I should confidently use all of these platforms.

Start by giving me a simple learning roadmap, then ask if I’m ready for Lesson 1.

## ASSISTANT:
(Provided a complete multi-module roadmap covering Google tools, step-by-step, from account setup to full production workflows. Asked user to type READY for Lesson 1.)

## USER:
Before we begin, what about Google Colab?

---

## ASSISTANT:
Explained what Colab is, why it is essential, how it fits the Soarix ecosystem, how it integrates with tools, how it helps a non-technical founder prototype everything quickly.

Explained emotional + executive insights, and confirmed that Colab will be woven into lessons starting from Lesson 1.

Asked user to type READY to proceed.

## USER:
Yes, to begin with first we need to know how to use google colab and how to integrate it with offline tool like VS code.

---

## ASSISTANT:
Explained Colab basics and two integration methods:

### Option A — GitHub Sync Workflow  
Beginner-friendly workflow:  
Edit in VS Code → push to GitHub → open in Colab → save back.

### Option B — Local Runtime Connection  
Advanced workflow:  
Install Jupyter + colab runtime extension locally → Colab connects to local machine.

Included examples:  
• mounting Google Drive  
• installing libraries  
• saving files  
• calling external APIs  

Then asked user whether to choose Option A or Option B to begin.
