## Assistant
Yes — this workflow diagram is solid. It reflects standard agentic design patterns used in modern AI systems (prompt chaining, routing, orchestration, parallelization, evaluator loops).  
Whether it “works” depends on what you're trying to build.  
Then provided:  
- Big picture summary  
- Layer architecture  
- Monetisation angles  
- Delegation map  
- Learning notes  
- Next steps

Explained that the diagram represents agentic workflow patterns:

- Prompt chaining  
- Routing  
- Parallelization  
- Orchestrator  
- Evaluator–optimizer loop  

Clarified that each brain icon is an LLM call, arrows represent data flow, and purple nodes represent application logic.  
Provided simple explanations for each pattern, why they are useful, how they relate to Soarix, and how they fit into agentic AI systems.
