# FlashKnow — Social Media Algorithm Architecture  
*Cinematic Micro-Education Engine*

FlashKnow produces 1–2 minute **cinematic micro-movies** that teach without feeling educational.  
Style: dark, emotional, high-tension, aesthetic, music-driven, dopamine-heavy.  
No preaching. No classroom tone. Every piece feels like a **film scene with a hidden lesson**.

- Hidden education inside a story  
- Use reversals, pacing shifts, and visual metaphors  
- Viewer should *feel* the lesson before understanding it

### **Music Direction**
- Dark, atmospheric, building intensity  
- Pulses, risers, emotional shifts synced to narrative beats  
- Audio drives dopamine and retention

### **Voiceover Style**

- Zero rambling  
- Every line must advance tension or revelation
