You are a senior growth marketer and category strategist. I want a complete, actionable plan to launch and grow a movement-first category and product following the "Inbound Playbook" and the three eras of discovery (SEO → Social/Algo → AEO), based on Dharmesh Shah’s inbound lessons and the podcast notes.

Details:
- COMPANY NAME: Acme Labs
- MOVEMENT NAME (1–3 words): Open Growth
- AUDIENCE: early-stage SaaS founders and growth marketers
- PRIMARY GOAL (90 days): 1,000 signups, 200 organic visits/day
- RESOURCES (team size, budget): team of 4 (founder, content, dev, community), budget $5,000/month

Required deliverables (combine insights from the Inbound Playbook + Evolution of Getting Discovered + Timeless Strategies):

1. One-sentence movement statement and a 50-word manifesto.  
2. 90-day roadmap broken into weekly tasks with owners, outputs, and success metrics.  
3. SEO pillar article outline (H1, H2s, intro, 40–60 word AEO-optimized lead answer, 6 FAQ Q&A pairs).  
4. Social strategy for algorithmic distribution: 3 repeatable hooks + 6 content templates (short video, carousel, LinkedIn thread, Twitter/X post, 60-sec video script).  
5. Community plan: platform choice, onboarding flow, 8 movement-first rules, and event agenda (non-pitch).  
6. MVP tool spec: 3 core features, success metrics, and a free-to-paid flow.  
7. Growth experiments: 6 prioritized experiments with hypothesis, metric, and duration.  
8. Measurement dashboard: 8 KPIs with target ranges (SEO, social, AEO, community, product adoption).  
9. Two example blog titles + full intro + 300-word sample section.  
10. AEO optimization instructions + JSON-LD FAQ schema snippet for the pillar article.

Constraints:  
- Tone: authoritative yet friendly.  
- Only white-hat strategies (no black-hat hacks or spam).  
- Prioritize long-term compounding assets (content, community, product) over ads.  
- Keep technical requirements realistic for a small team.  

Output the full plan in clearly numbered steps, checklists, and templates that can be copied directly into Notion, Slack, or a social scheduler.

9. Example Blog Titles + Content
Titles:

“Open Growth: The Future of SaaS Marketing in 2025”

“Why the Next Era of Inbound Isn’t SEO or Social—It’s AEO”

Full Intro (for Title 2):
Inbound has always evolved. First, it was SEO, where keywords ruled. Then came social, where algorithms decided reach. Now we’re in the age of AEO—Answer Engine Optimization—where founders win by being the best answer. This article explains how SaaS startups can thrive in this new inbound era.

300-Word Sample Section:

What Is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?
AEO is about optimizing for answers, not just keywords. With AI search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google’s SGE, users no longer sift through 10 blue links—they expect a direct, high-quality answer. For SaaS founders, this means structuring your content so it’s not only discoverable but also quotable.
For example, instead of writing a vague blog post on “growth strategies,” you’d structure it with clear FAQs, concise definitions, and bullet-point takeaways. Each of these can be surfaced as a direct answer in AI engines.
The advantage? Compounding visibility. Unlike social posts that fade in days, AEO-optimized content grows more valuable over time. Done well, it earns you the position of “default answer” in your category. Open Growth is designed for this era, where being useful and transparent isn’t just good ethics—it’s the best SEO strategy.

10. AEO Optimization + JSON-LD Schema
Instructions:

Use short, 40–60 word lead answers at top of each section.

Format FAQs with <h3> + direct answer (2–3 sentences).

Add bullet points for clarity.

Use schema markup for Google + AI crawlers.

JSON-LD FAQ Snippet:

<script type="application/ld+json">

  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the Open Growth framework?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Open Growth is a transparent, community-driven approach to SaaS growth. It emphasizes shared playbooks, open knowledge, and compounding assets instead of short-term growth hacks."
      }
    },
    {

      "name": "How is Open Growth different from traditional growth hacking?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Growth hacking focuses on quick wins and hacks, while Open Growth builds long-term compounding assets like content, community, and sustainable tools."
      }
    }
  ]
}
</script>
✅ This plan is movement-first, built on white-hat inbound, and realistic for a 4-person team with $5k/month.

Would you like me to also create a Notion template version (with checklists + task owners) so you can directly drop it into your workspace?
