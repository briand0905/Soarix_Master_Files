If you want, I can also:

📌 **Split this into Part 1 / Part 2 / Part 3** if you're pasting into tools with size limits.
📌 **Generate an indexed, hyperlinked version** for your Soarix OS Vault.
📌 **Convert this into PDF, DOCX, or Notion-ready import format**.

Just tell me the format you prefer.
