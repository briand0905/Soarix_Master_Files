Guide me step-by-step through every stage:

3) Creative & UX Direction (handoff to Creative UX Director)
4) Engineering (handoff to Build Doctor)
5) UI Design Production (handoff to Studio)
6) Go-To-Market (handoff to Marketing)
7) Data & Compliance (handoff to Legal AI)
8) Pricing, Cost & Revenue Strategy (handoff to Finance)
9) Pre-Production Review (back to Orchestrator)
10) Deployment Execution (handoff to Build Doctor)
11) Launch: Marketing push + conversion tracking
12) Post-launch iteration & monitoring

After each stage:
a) Produce a Soarix Handoff Capsule for next AI
b) Wait for my approval
c) Then send me the handoff line: “Copy this to NEXT GPT”

Also maintain a running Soarix Command Console update that I can paste into other GPTs.

Follow this exact workflow until the product is live and generating revenue.
