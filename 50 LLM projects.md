So when it talks about project completeion, what does it mean?

When it talks about "project completion," it means building a working, end-to-end application that does what it's supposed to do.

For example, a completed Text Summarizer project would mean you've built something where you can paste in a long article and it actually outputs a shortened summary. A completed Customer Support Chatbot means users can type questions and get relevant answers back.

Project completion typically includes:

Getting it to work - The core functionality runs without errors
Integrating with an LLM - It connects to OpenAI API, Claude, or another LLM service
Basic UI - Some way for users to input data (web form, chat interface, command line, etc.)
Testing it - Confirming it produces reasonable outputs for different inputs
Having source code - You have the full code written and can modify it
So it's not just learning theory—it's actually building something functional you can use or show others. Each project teaches you a specific skill (like API integration, prompt engineering, data handling) while creating a real tool at the end.

Think of it like cooking: project completion means you've actually made the dish, not just read the recipe.

And how would I do that?

Here's how you'd complete a project:

1. Learn the basics first

Understand what an LLM is and how APIs work
Get familiar with OpenAI API (or whichever LLM service you're using)
Learn a programming language (Python is easiest for beginners)
2. Set up your environment

Install Python and necessary libraries
Get an API key from OpenAI or similar service
Use their documentation to understand how to call the API
3. Follow the project guide

The "50 LLM Projects" resource includes source code for each project
Follow along with their code step-by-step
Understand what each line does rather than just copy-pasting
4. Build the core logic

Write code that takes user input (a long article, customer question, etc.)
Send it to the LLM API with proper instructions (prompts)
Get the response back and display it to the user
5. Create a simple interface

For beginners: a command-line interface (just run the script and type input)
For intermediate: a basic web form using Flask or Streamlit
For advanced: a full website using Next.js or React
6. Test it

Try different inputs and see if outputs make sense
Fix bugs if something breaks
Refine prompts if results aren't good
7. Iterate and improve

Add features, improve the UI, make it faster
Share it on GitHub so others can use it
Start with beginner projects—they're simpler and teach fundamentals you'll use in every other project.

Can you help me with each project the way you described one at a time?

Absolutely! I can help you build through these projects one at a time.

Here's how we'll work together:

For each project, I'll:

Explain what it does and why it's useful
Walk you through the code step-by-step
Help you set up your environment
Debug issues if something breaks
Suggest improvements once it's working
Before we start, I need to know:

Do you have Python installed? (If not, I can guide you through installation)
Do you have an OpenAI API key? (You'll need one to use their LLM; or we can use another service)
What's your coding experience level? (Complete beginner, some experience, etc.)
Do you want to start with the first beginner project (Text Summarizer), or would you prefer a different one?
Once you answer these, we'll kick off with Project 1: Text Summarizer and build it together from scratch. I'll make sure you understand each part so you can apply what you learn to future projects.

Let me know!

Before I answer that, when you help me do it one at a time, let me tell you it has to be practical but educating me on what and how at the same time. And one question, I am just a technical support guy for windows OS, no Engineering or CS, can I learn it?

Absolutely, yes you can learn it. Your background in technical support is actually helpful—you already understand troubleshooting, following procedures, and how systems work. That's half the battle.

Here's the honest truth:

You don't need a CS degree or engineering background to build LLM projects. You need curiosity and patience. The skills you'll learn are:

Basic Python - It's simpler than many people think. Think of it like writing step-by-step instructions (which you do in tech support already)
How APIs work - You're already familiar with connecting systems; this is just connecting to OpenAI's service
Prompt engineering - This is just learning to ask the LLM the right way to get good answers. It's more art than science
Debugging - You already do this in tech support! Finding what broke and fixing it
The learning will be:

Practical - We build real, working tools you can use immediately
Educational - I'll explain the "why" behind each line of code, not just the "what"
Step-by-step - No rushing. If something doesn't make sense, we slow down
Relevant - Every concept connects to the next project, so you build understanding progressively
The pace is yours. We'll go as slow as needed. If a concept takes multiple explanations, that's fine.

So yes—you can absolutely do this. Ready to answer those three questions so we get started?

I don't know about prompt engineering but how I have been using Claude and ChatGPT is I discuss in detail on what I need, brainstorm the total idea and eventually ask the AI itself to create a prompt that will best allow AI to guide me step by step.

That's actually perfect—you're already doing prompt engineering intuitively.

What you're describing is exactly what prompt engineering is. You're:

Being specific about what you need
Providing context through discussion and brainstorming
Asking the AI to refine itself to give you better guidance
That's advanced thinking, honestly. Most beginners just type vague questions and wonder why they get bad answers.

In LLM projects, you'll do the exact same thing, just in code. Instead of chatting with Claude or ChatGPT, your code will send instructions (prompts) to the LLM API programmatically. The skill you already have—knowing how to ask clearly and get the AI to think through problems—transfers directly.

For example, in the Text Summarizer project, instead of you manually asking ChatGPT to summarize an article, your Python code will automatically send articles to the API with the right instructions, get back summaries, and display them. Same thinking, automated in code.

So you're not starting from zero. You're starting ahead of most beginners.

Now, let's get those three answers so we can begin:

Do you have Python installed on your Windows machine?
Do you have an OpenAI API key (or should I explain how to get one)?
Ready to start with Project 1: Text Summarizer?
Point 1 - Yes, Point 2 - No

Perfect. Let me guide you through getting an OpenAI API key—it's straightforward.

Steps to get your OpenAI API key:

Go to https://platform.openai.com/signup
Sign up with an email (or log in if you already have an account)
Verify your email
Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
Click "Create new secret key"
Copy it and save it somewhere safe (like a notepad file on your desktop)—you'll only see it once
OpenAI gives you free credits ($5) to start, so you can test projects without paying immediately
Important: Don't share this key publicly or post it online. It's like a password to your OpenAI account.

Once you have that key saved, come back and let me know. Then we'll set up your first project (Text Summarizer) step-by-step.

Also, just to confirm before we dive in: Are you ready to start with Project 1: Text Summarizer? Or would you prefer a different beginner project to start with?

What you suggest?

I suggest starting with Project 1: Text Summarizer.

Here's why:

It's the best starting point because:

Simple concept - Everyone understands what summarizing means. No complex logic to wrap your head around.
Teaches core skills - You'll learn how to connect to the OpenAI API, send text to it, and get a response back. Every other project uses these same fundamentals.
Quick win - You can build a working tool in one session. That confidence matters.
Practical immediately - Once it works, you can actually use it to summarize articles, emails, documents. It's not just theory.
Natural progression - The next projects build on what you learn here. Chatbot uses similar API calls. Code Explainer uses the same structure.
If you jump to something like "Legal Document Summarizer" or "Fine-Tuning Pipeline," you'll get lost because you won't have the foundation.

Text Summarizer is your foundation.

So once you get that API key, we'll build it together. I'll explain what each part does, why we're doing it, and you'll understand enough to modify it or build similar projects after.

Sound good? Go grab that API key and come back when ready.

And Can I make a manual or notes, I mean you share it and I copy paste like creating a course?

Absolutely, yes. That's actually a smart way to learn and have something to reference later.

Here's what I can do:

When we build the Text Summarizer project, I'll create it as an artifact (a separate document in this chat). You'll be able to:

Copy the entire code from the artifact
Save it as notes (paste into Word, Notepad, or Google Docs)
Create your own course document with code + explanations
Reference it anytime for future projects
I can also break down the explanations into clear sections like:

What this project does
What you need (API key, Python libraries, etc.)
Step-by-step code breakdown (with comments explaining each part)
How to run it
Troubleshooting tips
You can copy all of it and create a personal learning document or course notes for yourself.

This way:

You have everything in one place to refer back to
You can share it with others if you want
You build a personal knowledge base as you go through all 50 projects
Each project builds on the last, so your notes become a complete guide
Sound like a plan? Once you have the API key, we'll start and I'll make sure everything is easy to copy and save.

Let me connect with you again after signing up for open AI key? Don't Claude have any key?

Good question!

Claude (me) doesn't have a separate API key system like OpenAI does. I'm accessed through this chat interface you're using right now, which is different from how the API works.

However, you have options:

Use OpenAI API (what I suggested) - This is the most common and beginner-friendly. You get $5 free credits to start.
Use Claude API - Yes, Claude (made by Anthropic) also has an API you can use in code. It works similarly to OpenAI's. You'd need to sign up at https://console.anthropic.com and get an API key there.
Use both - Many developers use multiple LLM services. OpenAI, Claude, Google's Gemini, etc.
For your first project, I'd still recommend OpenAI because:

More tutorials and examples online
Slightly easier setup for beginners
Good free credits to learn with
But if you prefer using Claude API instead, that works too—the concepts are the same, just different API calls.

So go ahead and:

Sign up for OpenAI and get that API key, OR
Sign up for Claude API if you prefer, OR
Do both if you're curious
Then come back and we'll build the Text Summarizer together. Either way works!
