
unified theme prompt
executive prompt
commercial ready prompt
production ready prompt
For Soarix solutions, Soarix AI, Soarix Studios, Soarix Publishing, Soarix Nexus, Soarix Media and finally the general prompt. I would like you to make 2 prompts : unified theme + commercial ready and another executive prompt + commercial ready for each of the  above mentioned names to create full stack websites and how to run it like CEO/CTO, etc.

I'll create comprehensive prompts for each Soarix branch by combining the unified theme/commercial ready aspects with executive operational guidance. Let me start by reading the uploaded files to understand the complete context.


Reading the Soarix Executive Base System Guide to understand the architecture and branch structure

Now I'll create two comprehensive prompt sets for each branch. Let me build these systematically:


Creating the unified builder prompts (Theme + Commercial Ready) for all Soarix branches
soarix_builder_prompts.md

Creating the executive operator prompts (CEO/CTO guidance + Commercial Ready) for all Soarix branches
soarix_executive_prompts.md
Now let me move these files to the outputs directory so you can access them:


Copying both prompt files to the outputs directory for user access


Perfect! I've created two comprehensive prompt files for your Soarix ecosystem:

Will these individual prompts for each like soarix AI website prompt help me to build full stack websites, production and commerical ready codes - legally compliant and with general prompt, if it will help me to work any idea and get the website, apps, etc built?


Re-reading the Tech_stack_prompt.txt to understand the full scope of what was requested for production-ready, commercial compliance
Show working file
You're absolutely right to question this! Looking at your original Tech Stack Prompt, I see it requires much MORE detailed, actionable output than what I provided. The current prompts are high-level guidance, but they don't give you the complete, step-by-step technical implementation details needed to actually build production-ready code.

Let me create enhanced builder prompts that incorporate ALL the detailed requirements from your Tech Stack Prompt (sections A-O). These will give you COMPLETE, copy-paste ready scaffolds, deployment commands, CI/CD pipelines, and everything needed for legally compliant, production-ready builds.

Creating comprehensive, production-ready builder prompts that include all technical details from the tech stack prompt - with complete scaffolds, deployment commands, CI/CD, cost estimates, and legal compliance
I mean the .md for each that you built not the tech stack?

Ah, I understand now! You're asking if the individual prompts I created (the .md files for each Soarix branch) will actually help you build full-stack, production-ready, commercially compliant websites and apps.

Let me be completely honest with you:

❌ Current Status: NO, they are NOT complete enough
The prompts I created are high-level guidance and operational frameworks, but they lack the detailed technical specifications from your Tech Stack Prompt that would actually generate production-ready code.

What's MISSING from my current prompts:
❌ Complete repo scaffolds with actual code files
❌ Exact CLI commands for deployment (Render/Fly.io/Docker)
❌ GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows (license checks, security audits)
❌ Step-by-step build instructions (10-15 actionable steps)
❌ Cost breakdowns and provider verification with sources
❌ Copy-paste ready code snippets (package.json, routes, API endpoints)
❌ Security & legal compliance checklists
❌ India region optimization details

What they DO provide:
✅ Strategic guidance (what to build, why, when)
✅ Business/operational frameworks
✅ High-level tech stack suggestions
✅ Executive decision-making guidance

✅ What You ACTUALLY Need:
You need ENHANCED prompts that combine:

Your Tech Stack Prompt structure (sections A-O with all technical details)
Branch-specific focus (Soarix AI, Studios, Publishing, etc.)
Complete production readiness (legal, security, deployment)
Let me create proper, complete prompts that will actually generate production-ready code when pasted into an AI. Should I create these enhanced versions now?

So build the prompts again for each : like soarix solutions website prompt (combined with unified theme and commercial ready and production ready prompts with your recommendations tha's missing) and similar to all other 5 branches. Then the same with Soarix Solutions Executive prompt with commercial and production ready prompts and same to other 5. So in total you give with commercial and production ready combined with unified theme for websites and executive base prompts from executive prompts to run the business and I get 6 branches * 2, in total 12 but instead of .md it should be single code block for each. - Soarix Solutions Website - Soarix AI Website - Soarix Publishing Website - Soarix Media Website - Soarix Nexus Website - Soarix Studios Website - Soarix Solutions Executive - Soarix AI Executive - Soarix Publishing Executive - Soarix Media Executive - Soarix Nexus Executive - Soarix Studios Executive. And then General Website and General Executive prompts (where I will just enter the idea after brainstorming with you, post which you will be able to help me with the similar prompts like Soarix's above).

Show more
Perfect! I'll create 14 complete, production-ready prompts (12 branch-specific + 2 general) as single code blocks. Each will be comprehensive and ready to paste directly into any AI.

Let me build these systematically:


Creating comprehensive production-ready prompts for all Soarix branches - complete with technical stack, deployment, CI/CD, legal compliance. Starting with all 6 website builder prompts.
soarix_complete_prompts.md
I wanted one prompt in one doc and likewise 14 prompts. Can you do one at at time? I don't see anything on what you did in the last message.


Resolved to deliver individual prompts sequentially for user review.


You're absolutely right! Let me create them ONE AT A TIME as separate files, each containing a single complete prompt in a code block. Let me start with the first one:


2 steps

Moving the first prompt to outputs directory

now for executive prompt that you shared earlier and one which you will share here on, is that the one that will allow AI to help me step by step how to run that particular branch like an AI CEO from planning to executiion? If yes, next


Validated executive prompts guide operational business management comprehensively.





✅ YES - Exactly Right!
The Executive Prompts are your AI CEO/CTO advisors that help you:

What Executive Prompts DO:
📋 Strategic Planning - What should I focus on this month/quarter?
💰 Pricing Decisions - How much should I charge for this project?
👥 Client Management - How do I handle this difficult client situation?
📈 Growth Strategy - How do I get more clients? Scale revenue?
💵 Financial Planning - Am I profitable? What are my KPIs?
🚨 Crisis Management - Client unhappy, project late, payment issue - what do I do?
🎯 Daily Operations - What should I prioritize today/this week?
📊 Business Decisions - Should I add this service? Hire someone? Change pricing?
What They DON'T Do:
❌ They don't write code (that's what the Website Builder prompts do)
❌ They don't generate technical scaffolds
How They Work Together:
Website Builder Prompt → Builds the product (technical)
Executive Prompt → Runs the business (operational)

Example Workflow:

Use Executive Prompt: "How should I price a corporate website project?"
Get pricing strategy, proposal template, negotiation tactics
Use Website Builder Prompt: "Build the corporate website"
Get complete code, deployment, everything technical
Use Executive Prompt: "Client wants feature outside scope, what do I do?"
Get decision framework and response templates

Next and do answer though that prompt wont give me the codes but let say if as an AI CEO the prompt asks me to build something, then it will act like an AI devops or developer agent to guide me on how to builld it, right? Since my operations will be totally AI focussed and assisted and powered, technically anything it asks me to do so, he will guide me on how to do it for any branches of executive?


Clarified executive prompt capabilities as strategic guide, not code generator.
10s









✅ YES - Exactly Right! Here's How It Works:
The Executive → Technical Bridge
The Executive prompts WON'T generate code directly, BUT they WILL guide you technically when operations require it:

🔄 How Executive + Website Builder Work Together
Scenario 1: Executive Identifies Need
You: "Users are churning because they want team collaboration"

AI Executive:

Analysis: Yes, team features are critical for retention.

Here's what you need:
1. Team workspace (shared projects)
2. Invite system (email invitations)
3. Role-based permissions (admin/member)
4. Team billing (one owner pays for all)

NEXT STEPS:
Switch to your Soarix AI Website Builder prompt and ask:

"Add team collaboration features with:
- Team workspace creation
- Email invite system  
- Role-based access (admin/member/viewer)
- Team billing (owner pays for team)
- Use Supabase Row Level Security for permissions"

The Website Builder will generate all the code, database schemas, 
and deployment instructions.
Scenario 2: Executive Provides Technical Guidance
You: "How do I reduce my AI costs?"

AI Executive:

Your AI costs are 50% of revenue - here's the technical plan:

IMMEDIATE (This Week):
1. Implement Redis caching
   - Cache common queries for 1 hour
   - Expected savings: 60% of API calls
   
   Technical guide:
   a) Set up Upstash Redis (free tier)
   b) Before OpenAI call, check: redis.get(cacheKey)
   c) If hit: return cached response
   d) If miss: call OpenAI, cache result
   
   Want me to provide the exact code? Or use your Website 
   Builder prompt to add caching system.

2. Switch non-critical tasks to GPT-4o-mini
   - Classification, tagging: use mini ($0.15/1M vs $5/1M)
   - User-facing generation: keep GPT-4o
   
   Which endpoints should we downgrade? I can provide 
   the technical specification.

3. Implement rate limiting per tier
   - Free: 10/day
   - Pro: 100/day
   - Business: 1000/day
   
   Need implementation? Use your Website Builder to add 
   "rate limiting with Redis + Upstash per user tier"
See? The Executive gives you the PLAN and technical direction, then guides you to implement it.

Scenario 3: Executive Acts as DevOps Advisor
You: "My app is slow for India users"

AI Executive:

Latency issue - here's the technical solution:

DIAGNOSIS:
- You're on Vercel (USA only)
- Users in India: 200-300ms latency
- Need: Edge deployment or India region

SOLUTION OPTIONS:

Option A: Switch to Fly.io Mumbai region (BEST)
Technical steps:
1. Create fly.toml configuration
2. Set primary region: maa (Mumbai)
3. Deploy: fly deploy
4. Expected latency: <50ms for India users

I can provide the exact fly.toml config, or use your 
Website Builder prompt: "Migrate from Vercel to Fly.io 
with Mumbai region optimization"

Option B: Add Cloudflare CDN in front of Vercel
Technical steps:
1. Sign up for Cloudflare
2. Change DNS to Cloudflare
3. Enable caching rules
4. Expected: Static assets <30ms, API still ~200ms

Option C: Multi-region deployment
[More complex, recommend Option A first]

Which option do you want to implement? I'll guide you 
through the technical details.
🎯 The Power of the System
Executive Prompt = Your AI CTO/CEO
Makes strategic decisions
Analyzes problems
Provides technical specifications
Guides implementation approach
Acts as technical advisor when needed
Website Builder Prompt = Your AI Developer
Generates production code
Creates full scaffolds
Provides deployment configs
Implements features
💡 Real Workflow Example
Monday Morning:

Use Executive Prompt: "What should I focus on this week?"
Executive analyzes metrics, says: "Priority 1: Fix onboarding (40% drop-off)"
Monday Afternoon:

Still in Executive: "How do I fix onboarding?"
Executive provides: "Add interactive tutorial, pre-filled examples, progress indicator"
Tuesday:

Switch to Website Builder: "Add interactive onboarding with tutorial, examples, and progress bar"
Website Builder generates complete code
Wednesday:

Back to Executive: "Onboarding is deployed, what's next?"
Executive: "Priority 2: Add team features (requested by 15 users)"

For Soarix solutions website, I need a prompt that actually talks about Soarix Solutions as a main/parent company but don't need to mention it as parent company...But talk about the services we offer as below : This  website is mainly a parent company which has five branches under it. 
Soarix Studios - 3d rendering/modelling, etc
Soarix Media - digital media agency
Soarix AI - Build full stack apps, websites, extensions, SaaS, etc (no enterprise grade)
Soarix Publishing - blogs and book via AI
Soarix Nexus - AI apps and AI agents
All for clients - professionals, freelancers, small and medium scale level, etc
Each branch will have its own subdomain website like media.soarixsolutions.com, ai.soarixsolutions.com, so we need to have redirection page for each while this soarix solutions main website is all about talking about parent company and its branches of whats are done and if the clients need more information, can click on the link to check individual sites to understand the scope of services and accordingly contact us for the services required. The main page and centre of this isnt corporate web development only, hence it should have AI powered high res video talking about solutions that we offer for all that's mentioned using AI..It should talk about how we offer the services and about the business.

It has a fine high res video showing AI powered resolutions for different business like its mentioned for all the branches. Refine the prompt that actually talks about Soarix solutions as the main company, so does the website with subdomains links that will take it to the respective sites and this site itself shows why this company is the best solution for all the needs as per the branches. Create a prompt that will allow any AI to create a full stack website, responsive, animations, light and dark theme and a site that looks like any advanced full company that offers such solutions but it should be elegant and professional enough..can I have a standard theme which is modern, stylish and AI powered like AI revolution? It can show elegance like Apple website if required but not exactly the copy but based on that you can ask AI in the prompt to create a fine, creative front end.
