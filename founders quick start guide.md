## 🧩 Conversation Summary

### Purpose  
Brian (Founder, Soarix Solutions) requested a unified **cheat sheet + workflow playbook** for executing any business or IT idea under the *Advanced General Master Prompt (Step-by-Step Mode)* — merging brainstorming, building, compliance, and marketing into one clean, repeatable framework.

---

## 🧭 Final Deliverable
### “Founder's Master Cheat Sheet — General Prompt Workflow”

**Core Principle:**  
→ Start ideas in a **Temp Chat** (brainstorm with Micro-Template).  
→ Move into a **Regular Chat** (execution mode using the General Master Prompt).  
→ Advance only by explicit commands (`Step 1`, `Step 2`, etc.).  
→ Each step includes **Deliverables, Acceptance Criteria, Compliance Notes, and Next Actions**.

---

## ⚙️ Step Flow Overview
1. **Brainstorm & Validation** – idea refinement + competitor scan.  
2. **Revenue Model** – ₹1L/month viability check.  
3. **Tech Stack Selection** – free/cheap + compliant tools.  
4. **MVP Design** – wireframes + core features.  
5. **Prototype Build** – using Bubble/Webflow/Genie 2.  
6. **Backend Setup** – infra, CI/CD, backups.  
7. **Payments** – Stripe/Razorpay integration.  
8. **Marketing Assets** – SEO + landing + content.  
9. **Launch Plan** – store submission + go-live.  
10. **Compliance Package** – legal docs + policies.  
11. **Growth Automation** – Make/Zapier/Retool.  
12. **Expansion** – enterprise features, SOC2, partnerships.

## 🧠 Always-Active Protocols
**Legal & Compliance**
- Entity setup, ToS, Privacy, NDA, SOC2/GDPR/DPDP, IP rights, accessibility (WCAG).
- Ensure regional data residency & insurance (cyber + D&O).

**Security & Maintenance**
- Auto-updates, rollback switch, threat scans (Snyk, Dependabot, CodeQL).  
- Runtime monitoring (Falco, Wazuh).  
- Kill-switch + versioning.

**Feedback & Finance**
- User feedback loops, KPI pivot triggers, cost vs. revenue tracking.  
- Financial modeling for unit economics.
