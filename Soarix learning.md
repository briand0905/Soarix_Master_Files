## 💡 Step 1 — Roadmap Overview

### 1. Git (Version Control)
🔗 [git-scm.com/book](https://git-scm.com/book)  
Git is your foundation for managing and syncing code projects.

**Core steps:**
- Initialize repo (`git init`)
- Commit changes (`git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`)
- Push & pull (`git push`, `git pull`)
- Create & switch branches (`git branch`, `git checkout -b`)

**Mini project:**  
Create a GitHub repo named `learning-journey` to store all your learning code.

---

### 2. Python (Automation & Scripting)
🔗 [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org)  
Simple language for automation, backend logic, and cybersecurity tools.

**Steps:**
1. Basics: variables, loops, functions  
2. Intermediate: file handling, modules  
3. Learn libraries like `requests` and `os`  
4. Build small utilities  

**Mini projects:**
- Password generator  
- File organizer  
- Port scanner  

---

### 3. Cybersecurity
🔗 [tryhackme.com](https://tryhackme.com)  
Hands-on labs to understand hacking, security testing, and networking.

**Steps:**
- Start with *Intro to Cybersecurity* and *Linux Fundamentals*  
- Move to *Jr Penetration Tester Pathway*  
- Automate small security tasks with Python  

**Mini project:**  
Document TryHackMe labs on GitHub or a personal blog (for your portfolio).

---

### 4. Go (Backend & CLI Development)
🔗 [learn-golang.org](https://learn-golang.org)  
A fast, concurrent programming language for backend tools and automation.

**Steps:**
- Learn syntax: variables, structs, maps  
- Use goroutines for concurrency  
- Build simple CLI programs  

**Mini projects:**
- To-Do CLI  
- Port scanner  
- REST API server  

---

### 5. Rust (Systems Programming & Security)
🔗 [rust-lang.org/learn](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)  
Modern, memory-safe, high-performance systems language.

**Steps:**
- Study “The Rust Book”  
- Learn ownership, borrowing, lifetimes  
- Practice using Cargo  

**Mini projects:**
- CLI calculator  
- File encryptor  
- Rewrite your Go or Python port scanner in Rust

## ⚙️ Environment Setup (Based on Uploaded PDF)

The **Dev Environment Setup** guide:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} recommends:
- Ubuntu or Pop!_OS as base OS (in VM using VirtualBox)
- `git`, `build-essential`, `curl`, `wget` for setup
- Python managed via **pyenv**
- Node.js via **nvm**
- Docker & Docker Compose for isolated builds
- AI frameworks (Ollama, LM Studio) for local AI
- Security stack (UFW, Fail2Ban, Wazuh)
- Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Backup tools (Timeshift, rclone, rsync)

This environment is modular — supports both AI development (Soarix Nexus) and cybersecurity workflows.

## 🧩 Alignment with Soarix System Prompt V3

The **Soarix System Prompt V3**:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} defines how all builds and learning paths must align:
- Step-by-step learning for non-technical founders  
- Architecture-first mindset (frontend → backend → infra → AI)  
- Compliance & security (SOC 2, GDPR, DPDP)  
- Production-ready mindset (CI/CD, backups, rollback)  
- Ethical AI, transparent systems, and emotional UX design  
- Business awareness (cost, revenue, scalability)

## 🧠 Learning Notes

1. **Git = Time machine for your code.**
   Always commit early and often; you can recover any version.
2. **Python = Your automation Swiss knife.**
   Fast to learn, ideal for scripting, APIs, and cybersecurity tasks.
3. **Go = Backend speed with simplicity.**
   Perfect for building concurrent tools and APIs.
4. **Rust = Performance meets safety.**
   Used in browsers, kernels, and crypto systems.
5. **Cybersecurity = Understanding the system inside out.**
   Learn to attack to better defend.
