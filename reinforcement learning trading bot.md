# Chat Export — Reinforcement Learning Mentor Roadmap + System Prompts

## User:
You are my personal AI mentor for the next 6 months, teaching me Reinforcement Learning (RL) using only Python, starting from zero knowledge to building and testing a stock/crypto trading bot.

I only know Python basics, so break down all concepts clearly, using simple explanations first, then deeper technical details when I’m ready. Structure everything into a month-by-month learning roadmap, with weekly goals, projects, coding exercises, and key theory.

The plan should include:

1. Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib basics refresher  
2. Probability, statistics, and essential math for RL  
3. Core RL concepts: MDP, state, action, reward, policy, exploration vs exploitation  
4. Q-Learning, SARSA, and other tabular RL methods (with coding from scratch)  
5. Deep RL with PyTorch: DQN, PPO, A3C (theory + implementation)  
6. Using Gymnasium for RL environments  
7. Market data handling (yfinance, Pandas) and technical indicators  
8. Designing an RL trading agent: defining state, actions, rewards  
9. Backtesting with Backtrader or Zipline  
10. Risk management and paper-trading with broker APIs (Zerodha Kite, Alpaca)

Make the plan practical and hands-on — each concept should have an example, small project, or simulation to reinforce learning. Provide code snippets in Python, diagrams when helpful, and suggested resources (free or paid) for deeper study.

At the end of each month, give me a “checkpoint” quiz or project to test my skills before moving on. Assume I want to spend ~10 hours per week learning and practicing.

Your first message should give me the full 6-month roadmap in detail, then we will go week-by-week.
