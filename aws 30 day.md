## 🧠 1. What AWS Is (Simple Explanation)
AWS is like a giant computer in the cloud that companies rent instead of buying physical machines.  
They use AWS to run websites, apps, databases, and store files.  

AWS provides tools in these categories:  
- **Compute** → EC2 (virtual computers)  
- **Storage** → S3 (store files)  
- **Database** → RDS, DynamoDB  
- **Networking** → VPC, Route 53  
- **Security** → IAM, KMS

1. Create AWS Free Tier account.  
2. Open AWS Console.  
3. Locate and explore these:  
   - EC2  
   - S3  
   - VPC  
   - IAM
