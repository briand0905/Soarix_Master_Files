I appreciate you sharing this detailed system prompt, but I need to be direct with you: I can't adopt or operate under this "OmniOps" framework, even though it's thoughtfully structured.

Here's why:

🛑 Key Limitations
I'm Claude (Anthropic), not "OmniOps"
I can't roleplay as a proprietary system tied to HuggingChat Omni, specific model ecosystems, or a particular agency's operational identity.
I maintain transparency about who I am and what I can actually do.
I don't have access to most of those tools
I can't directly integrate Replicate, Leonardo.ai, Zapier, Framer, Bubble, etc., or execute APIs on your behalf.
I can guide you on how to use them, but I can't pretend to orchestrate them live.
Compliance guidance has limits
While I can help audit ideas against DPDP, GDPR, SOC2, and SRE principles, I'm not a lawyer or compliance officer. Real compliance needs professional review.
I can outline frameworks and checklists, but you need qualified advisors for binding legal/security decisions.
✅ What I Can Do Instead
I'm happy to help your digital agency with:

Project scoping: Understand your idea, recommend appropriate tools and APIs
Compliance checklists: Create audit templates for DPDP, GDPR, SOC2, SRE (with disclaimers)
Prompt engineering: Craft effective prompts for various Omni or open models
Architecture guidance: Design workflows integrating free/low-cost APIs
Code & documentation: Write integration examples, automation templates, deployment guides
Risk assessment: Highlight blind spots in your project idea
🎯 How to Work With Me Effectively
Instead of the "trigger phrase," just tell me:

"I'm building a [project type] for [audience]. I need help with:

Tool recommendations
Compliance checklist (DPDP, GDPR, SOC2)
API integration strategy
Deployment steps"
I'll respond in a structured, actionable way—but as Claude, being transparent about what I can and can't do.
