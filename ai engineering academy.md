- Weekly lessons  
- Real projects  
- Portfolio building on GitHub  
- Ethical & sustainable AI practices  
- Executive awareness for business, compliance, and monetization

# 📘 WEEK 1 — Orientation, Tools & Python Basics

### What You’ll Learn
- How this course works (weekly → portfolio → job-ready).
- Setting up your coding environment (Python, Google Colab, VS Code).
- Writing and running your first Python script (`hello.py`).
- Basics of Git/GitHub (repositories, commits, pushes).
- Publishing your first project on GitHub 🎉.

---

### Why It Matters
All AI engineers — even at Google or OpenAI — start with:
1. Writing scripts in Python.  
2. Using GitHub for version control.  
3. Running code experiments in the cloud.

This week builds your foundation to **set up, code, and share projects**, which is essential before moving to AI or ML.

### Resources (Free First)
- [Python Official Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [GitHub Hello World Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world)

---

### Hands-On Lab

**Goal:** Create a GitHub repo with a working Python script.

1. **Create GitHub Account** → github.com/signup  
2. **New Repository:** `week-1-hello-python`  
3. **Create File:** `hello.py`
   ```python
   # hello.py
   def greet(name="World"):
       return f"Hello, {name}!"

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       print(greet())
````

4. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python hello.py
   ```

   Output: `Hello, World!`

5. **Commit & Push to GitHub**

6. **Add README.md**

   * One-line summary
   * How to run it
   * What you learned

7. **(Optional)**: Run same code in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) → “Save a copy to GitHub”.

### Quiz / Challenge

1. Why is GitHub important for AI projects?
2. Modify `hello.py` to print your own name.
3. Create a branch called `practice`, add a file `note.txt` with one thing you learned, and merge it via Pull Request.
4. (Stretch) Run `hello.py` on Google Colab and save notebook to GitHub.

## 🧾 Executive Insight (Soarix Context)

This first week forms the **operational base layer** for all future Soarix builds.
It aligns with:

* **Soarix AI** (core development workflows)
* **Soarix Publishing** (AI-generated educational content)
* **Soarix Nexus** (R&D experiments via Python notebooks)

From here, we’ll move toward *Python problem-solving, data analysis, and model fundamentals* — stepping gradually into **AI Engineering Level 0**.

## 🪜 What’s Next

When you’re ready, type **“Next week”** — you’ll unlock:

**Week 2: Python Foundations & Problem-Solving**
→ Loops, conditionals, functions, and your first mini data project.

---

**This document combines:**

* Soarix Executive Orchestrator framework (from uploaded prompt)
* Dev Environment Setup guidelines
* AI Engineering Levels (Zach Wilson)
* Year 1 curriculum and Week 1 tutorial
* Beginner-friendly path (no technical background required)
