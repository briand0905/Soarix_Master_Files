# Soarix Systems Thinking Course — Week 1 Setup

## 🧭 Conversation Summary

**User Goal:**  
Brian wants a complete 12–14 week Systems Thinking course structured for practical application in **software development, cybersecurity, and AI engineering**.  

**Tutor Role:**  
AI mentor with 30+ years of cross-domain experience, teaching in simple steps, with assignments, resources, quizzes, and real-world use cases.

## 📘 Week 1 — Introduction to Systems Thinking

### 🎯 Goals
- Understand **what systems thinking is** (and is not).  
- Learn **key concepts**: system, boundary, elements, interconnections, purpose.  
- Get introduced to **feedback loops** (reinforcing & balancing).  
- Do your **first mini exercise**: map a simple system in your daily life.

### 1. What is Systems Thinking?

Systems thinking = seeing **wholes rather than parts**.  
You don’t just look at isolated events or single causes — you focus on:
- **Relationships** between elements.  
- **Patterns** that repeat over time.  
- **Feedback** that drives change.  

> “A system is a set of elements interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time.” — *Donella Meadows, Thinking in Systems*

### 2. Key Concepts

**System**  
A system = *elements + interconnections + purpose*.  
Example: A software team → people + tools + processes + goal (deliver working software).

**Boundaries**  
Where do you stop drawing the box?  
Example: Is your “system” just the dev team, or does it include management, users, and vendors?

**Feedback Loops**
- **Reinforcing (Positive)** → growth or decline that accelerates.  
  Example: More users → more data → better AI → more users.
- **Balancing (Negative)** → seeks stability.  
  Example: Thermostat adjusts temperature when it drifts too high or low.

**Stocks & Flows**
- **Stock** = something measurable (number of open GitHub issues).  
- **Flow** = rate of change (issues opened or closed per day).

### 3. Why Systems Thinking Matters for Tech

| Domain | Systems Example |
|--------|----------------|
| **Cybersecurity** | More breaches → stronger security → smarter attackers → new breaches. |
| **Software Dev** | Quick fixes → technical debt → slower progress → more quick fixes. |
| **AI Engineering** | More recommendations → more engagement → algorithm bias → stronger loop. |

---

### 4. Visual Archetypes

**Reinforcing Loop (R):**  
More X → More Y → More X → Growth/Collapse.

**Balancing Loop (B):**  
More X → More Y → Less X → Stability.

---

### 5. Recommended Reading & Resources
- *Thinking in Systems* by Donella Meadows (Chapters 1–2).  
- Article: “Systems Thinking: A Beginner’s Guide” (free online).  
- YouTube: “Systems Thinking Explained” — Peter Senge (10 min).

### 6. 🧠 Exercise — Your First System Map

Choose **one simple everyday system** and describe it:
1. Define its **elements**, **interconnections**, and **purpose**.  
2. Identify at least **one reinforcing** and **one balancing** loop.

Examples:
- Your morning routine (wake up → coffee → alertness → productivity).  
- Social media (posts → likes → dopamine → more posts).  
- A work task queue (tickets → processing → backlog → pressure).

You can draw a small loop diagram or describe it in words.

---

### 7. Quick Quiz
1. What are the three components of a system?  
2. What’s the difference between a reinforcing and balancing loop?  
3. Why do system boundaries matter?

### 📅 Week 2 Preview
Next week → *Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs)* — your first real modeling tool, using examples from software bug cycles and feedback-rich systems like Netflix recommendations.

## 🧩 Notes for Tutor Integration
The uploaded references provide:
- A detailed Soarix tech ecosystem and preferred workflow (Ubuntu + VM-based setup).  
- Guidance for maintaining production-quality standards (SOC 2, GDPR, CI/CD).  
- The Orchestrator’s instruction style: stepwise, patient, and architecture-first.  

Future Systems Thinking lessons will connect theory (feedback loops, archetypes) to these operational layers — particularly DevOps, cybersecurity, and AI model feedback systems.

### ✅ Next Step
Submit your **Week 1 Exercise** — either a diagram or short paragraph describing your chosen system.  
Your tutor will provide detailed feedback on your loops, clarity, and possible hidden leverage points.
