# Soarix Terminal-First AI Training — Full Conversation Log

## 🧭 Context
This session is about learning to use **terminal-first AI tools** to build production-ready full-stack apps, SaaS systems, images, videos, and automated posts — all with a focus on clarity, simplicity, and safety.

---

## 👤 User Environment
- **OS**: Dual Boot (Windows 11 Pro + Pop!_OS)
- **GPU**: AMD Radeon 7800XT  
- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 7800X3D  
- **Primary OS for development**: Windows 11 Pro

---

## 💬 Conversation Summary

### Step 0 — Setup Questions
**AI:**  
Which OS are you using?  
Do you have a GPU on that machine?  

**User:**  
> I use dual boot: Windows 11 Pro and Pop!_OS (will mainly use Windows).  
> GPU: 7800XT with 7800X3D CPU.

**AI:**  
Perfect — excellent hardware and OS setup. Both are strong for AI dev. We’ll focus on Windows but include Pop!_OS notes too.

### Step 1 — Terminal Check & Basics
**Goal:** Make sure the command-line (CLI) works.

**Command:**
```powershell
echo "Hello, Terminal is working!"
````

**Expected Output:**

```
Hello, Terminal is working!
```

**Verification Checklist:**

```powershell
# Verify: echo "Hello, Terminal is working!"
```

**Why it matters:**
Everything you’ll install or build runs through this window. If the terminal doesn’t work, no other step will.

**Tip:**
Keep two terminal tabs — one for learning and one for testing — to avoid confusion later.

### AgenticSeek Discussion

**User:**

> What about this project: [https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek](https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek)

**AI:**
Can’t open the URL directly, but confirmed AgenticSeek is a **local-first autonomous agent framework**.

### AgenticSeek Overview

**User:**

> Here’s the official link: [http://agenticseek.tech](http://agenticseek.tech)

**AI Summary:**
**AgenticSeek** is an **open-source, private, on-device AI agent**.
It can:

* Plan and execute tasks
* Write and run code (Python, C, Go, Java)
* Browse and fill web forms
* Operate entirely offline
* Use voice commands

It’s like a private version of **Manus AI** or **ChatGPT + Browser + Coder** — but running on your own hardware.

**How it fits your roadmap:**

* Belongs to **Part F (Automation & Agents)** and supports **Part G (Production)** later.
* Can self-manage workflows and build entire local AI assistants.
* Can connect to **Ollama** or **LM Studio** as the AI brain.

**Hardware Fit:**
Your 7800XT + 7800X3D setup is perfect for it.

**Tip:**
Keep AgenticSeek in its own folder (like `C:\agenticseek`) and don’t run it as admin unless needed.

**Next Option:**
Start with **Step 1: Install AgenticSeek CLI** for Windows and optional Pop!_OS.

### Uploaded Files

You uploaded:

1. **`dev environment setup.pdf`** — detailed list of foundational tools, install commands, and system setup notes.
2. **`Soarix System Prompt V3.docx`** — defines Soarix’s executive, technical, and orchestration framework.

Both will serve as **core references** for:

* Setting up your development environment.
* Maintaining consistent “architecture-first” builds.
* Enforcing security, compliance, and scalability standards.

## 🧱 Next Steps (Paused)

Once you confirm “**Done**” or “**I learned this**”, the next micro-step will be:

### Step 2 — File Paths & Navigation

We’ll learn how to move between folders, create new project directories, and list files — the building blocks of real command-line development.

---

## 🧭 Learning Notes

* The terminal is the heart of all automation and AI integration.
* Local-first tools (like AgenticSeek or Ollama) keep your data private and reduce cloud costs.
* Always verify small steps first — never skip basic tests before complex builds.
* Keep backups of your environment files and configs.

**Status:** ✅ Awaiting user confirmation to proceed to Step 2
(“Done” or “I learned this”)

```

Would you like me to include the next **Step 2 (File paths & navigation)** directly into this same markdown file as continuation?
