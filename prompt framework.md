## 💬 Chat Transcript

**User:**  
You are my AI assistant and will use structured prompt frameworks when I ask for help.  
Here are the frameworks you must remember, along with definitions, when to use them, why they matter, and how they should be applied:  

### 1. APE Framework (Action → Purpose → End Goal)
- **Definition:**  
  - Action: What the AI should do.  
  - Purpose: Why this task is important.  
  - End Goal: What the final output should achieve.  
- **When to use:** For simple, direct tasks (content writing, summaries, email drafts).  
- **Why:** Ensures AI understands both the *task* and the *bigger picture outcome.*  
- **How:** Use a clear verb (Action), reasoning (Purpose), and define result (End Goal).

### 2. PECRA Framework (Persona → Example → Context → Request → Adjustments)
- **When to use:** For creative or nuanced outputs like blogs, lessons, or campaigns.  
- **Why:** Aligns tone, context, and personalization.

### 3. OSCAR Framework (Objective → Scope → Constraints → Action → Reflection)
- **When to use:** For planning, IT projects, or structured analysis.  
- **Why:** Keeps complex tasks scoped and aligned.

### 4. TAG Framework (Task → Audience → Goal)
- **When to use:** For short, targeted outputs like social media or ads.  
- **Why:** Keeps messaging focused and clear.

**Instruction:**  
Whenever I say “Use [Framework],” respond in that structure.  
If not specified, choose one, apply it, and explain *why.*

---

**Assistant:**  
Understood.  
I’ll remember all four frameworks and apply them accordingly.  
If no framework is specified, I’ll pick the best one for the context and explain why.  
Would you like me to prepare a one-page cheat sheet for reference?

**User:**  
<<ImageDisplayed>>What about this prompt?

---

**Assistant:**  
This image shows your **Lyra Master Prompt**, an advanced meta-optimizer system.  
It uses the **4D Methodology (Deconstruct → Diagnose → Develop → Deliver)** — a consulting-style process for refining prompts.  

**Relation to the 4 frameworks:**
Lyra isn’t a replacement but a *meta layer* that improves how those frameworks are chosen and applied.  
Think of it as a **Prompt OS**, where APE/PECRA/OSCAR/TAG are **apps** inside it.  

```

Lyra 4D = Meta Optimizer
↓
Chooses Framework (APE / PECRA / OSCAR / TAG)
↓
Delivers Final Optimized Output

```

Recommended: Keep Lyra for optimization, and the frameworks for actual execution.

**User:**  
I have the question before you do that — will this combined prompt be better, or the one where I discuss with you dynamically (for app, website, project creation)?

---

**Assistant:**  
Excellent strategic question.  

**Option 1 — Combined Super Prompt:**  
✅ Always consistent, structured, reusable.  
⚠️ Heavy, less flexible, slower for small tasks.

**Option 2 — Dynamic Discussion:**  
✅ Adaptive, tailored to each project.  
⚠️ Slightly slower start, but higher creativity.  

**Verdict:**  
Since you build diverse things (apps, AI systems, business models), the **dynamic method** is smarter.  
You’ll get the flexibility of real-time orchestration with framework precision.

Would you like a **hybrid model** — a short always-on core plus a dynamic layer for builds?

---

**User:**  
Yes, create a hybrid prompt for general use (learning, tutoring) but use dynamic mode for projects.

---

**Assistant:**  
Perfect ✅  

Here’s the **Hybrid Prompt** combining lightweight Lyra + frameworks + dynamic switching logic.

---

## 🌍 Hybrid Prompt: “General AI Assistant + Optimizer”

```

You are my **AI Assistant + Prompt Optimizer**.
Apply a lightweight version of Lyra’s 4D method (Deconstruct → Diagnose → Develop → Deliver).

Choose and apply the right framework:
• APE → For simple tasks (summaries, emails, short drafts)
• PECRA → For styled/creative tasks (blogs, lessons, campaigns)
• OSCAR → For structured analysis/planning (projects, IT systems)
• TAG → For quick, audience-focused outputs (ads, posts)

MODE SELECTION:

* General Mode (default): Use frameworks directly.
* Dynamic Project Mode (manual trigger): If I say “Project / Build / Business / Website / App,” pause → co-create a **custom master prompt**.

RESPONSE FORMAT:

* Always show output in the chosen framework structure.
* End with a short note on *why that framework fits.*
* If missing info, ask 2–3 clarifying questions first.

GOALS:

* Practical, structured, easy to follow.
* Tutor me step-by-step when learning.
* Deliver usable, polished results.
* Switch to co-creation for business or project mode.

```

**Usage Summary:**  
- Use for daily tutoring, writing, learning.  
- For projects: say **“Dynamic Project Mode: [describe project]”** and I’ll switch to build orchestration.

**User:**  
Perfect. Then I uploaded these files:  
- `dev environment setup.pdf`  
- `Soarix System Prompt V3.docx`

Would you like me to:

1. Format this `.md` file for **GitHub README style**, or
2. Prepare it as a **local “Soarix Prompt Framework Reference” document** with table of contents and section links?
