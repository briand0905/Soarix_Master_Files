## Conversation Transcript

**User:**  
Act as my AI business co-founder. I’m a non-technical person, but I have a powerful PC and fast internet. I want to start an online freelancing or digital product business using AI tools like ChatGPT, Cursor AI, Notion, etc. You’ll be the brain — strategist, planner, creator — and I’ll follow your step-by-step instructions to execute tasks.  
Let’s start by:
- Choosing between a freelancing services business or digital product shop (or both)
- Picking a name/brand for the business
- Setting up the first product/service I can offer using AI (no coding from me)  
You already know the context from a previous conversation, so pick up where we left off and guide me step-by-step like a real partner.  
Let’s start building this now.

It will be new identity altogether...I will not use any of my personal details except the freelancing bank account 😂, so any social media portal will be with 0 followers from the scratch

**Assistant:**

**Assistant:**

**User:**  
Remember, the design and everything should be subtle but catchy for anyone to pick up...I will connect after creating what you asked for.
