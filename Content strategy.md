Thought for a few seconds
Short summary
Nice — I converted your brief into a ready-to-run content strategy template plus a fully filled example for the niche I already know you care about (early-stage SaaS founders & growth marketers). Use the template to drop in any other niche/audience later. I assume 2 posts/week, solo creator, small team. If you want a different cadence or team size, tell me and I’ll adapt immediately.

1) Quick analysis — top-performing content patterns (how winners behave)
Key patterns across SEO + social winners in B2B SaaS / growth niches

Problem-first headlines: “How to get your first 100 customers” beats vague “why growth matters.”

Tactical, reproducible frameworks: checklists, templates, 30/60/90 day plans — readers can act immediately.

Case studies with numbers: short narrative + concrete metrics (e.g., “From $0 → $10k MRR in 90 days using X”).

Threadable micro-content: long-form study → dozens of short social posts (X/LinkedIn).

SEO pillars with long-tail clusters: one canonical pillar page + many cluster posts targeting long-tail queries.

Multiformat funnels: blog → newsletter → LinkedIn summary → YouTube explainer → short-form clips.

Strong lead magnet + CTAs: templates, spreadsheets, or email courses that capture leads.

Visual-heavy social: carousels, short explainer videos and charts perform well for attention.

2) 8 high-potential content ideas (viral + SEO potential)
I’ll list each idea with: short description + why it works.

“First 90 Days Growth Plan for Seed SaaS” — downloadable 90-day checklist & timeline.
Why: high intent, repeatable, evergreen; good lead magnet.

“Playbook: How we acquired 300 users in 60 days without paid ads” (case study)
Why: numbers + narrative = shareable and credible.

“10 Growth Experiments to Run This Week (with scorecard)”
Why: tactical, quick wins; great for social sharing.

“SEO Keyword Map for B2B SaaS (2025) — 40 keyword ideas + content brief”
Why: practical asset that gets links and saves time for readers.

“The Outreach Email Sequence That Converts 5–8% (copy + templates)”
Why: templates convert well and are bookmarked / forwarded.

“Failures We Learned From: 5 Marketing Experiments That Flopped (and the fix)”
Why: vulnerability + lessons = strong engagement.

“LinkedIn Growth Engine: How to turn posts into leads” (step-by-step guide)
Why: platform-specific playbooks are highly shareable.

“AI Tools Stack for Growth Marketers — How to use them (with prompts)”
Why: topical, high search interest, useful for immediate adoption.

4) Map ideas to awareness stages (TOFU / MOFU / BOFU)
TOFU (Awareness) — attract broad interest

10 Growth Experiments; AI Tools Stack; SEO Keyword Map (overview); Failures We Learned From.

MOFU (Consideration) — engage and capture interest with tactics

LinkedIn Growth Engine; Outreach Email Sequence; First 90 Days Plan (intro).

BOFU (Decision) — convert visitors into leads/customers

300 Users Case Study; First 90 Days Plan (gated template); Outreach Email Sequence (CRM import + demo offer).

5) 30-day content calendar (assumes: 2 publishes/week, solo creator)
Goal: sustainable cadence, repurposing built-in. Channels: Blog (long-form), Newsletter, LinkedIn (posts + carousel), YouTube (short explainer and short clips), X/Twitter threads, Instagram repurposes.

Week 1

Day 1 (Mon): Publish “10 Growth Experiments” blog (TOFU).
Repurpose same day: X thread (10 tweets), LinkedIn post + carousel (5 slides), 1-minute TikTok/YouTube Short summarizing top 3 experiments.

Day 4 (Thu): Short newsletter + CTA to blog. Save email list leads.

Week 2

Day 8 (Mon): Publish “AI Tools Stack for Growth” blog (TOFU).
Repurpose: LinkedIn carousel, 2 short videos showing 2 workflows, X thread with prompts.

Day 11 (Thu): Publish LinkedIn deep post (MOFU) — mini-case from your experiments + link to experiments blog.

Week 3

Day 15 (Mon): Publish “First 90 Days Growth Plan” long-form (MOFU) + gated template.
Repurpose: Create 5-part LinkedIn post series slicing the 90-day plan, and a 5-minute YouTube explainer.

Day 18 (Thu): Send newsletter featuring the 90-day template as lead magnet.

Week 4

Day 22 (Mon): Publish “How we acquired 300 users in 60 days” case study (BOFU).
Repurpose: LinkedIn carousel “Key results + 3 experiments that worked”, X thread, 3 short clips (15–30s each).

Day 25 (Thu): Publish “Outreach Email Sequence” (BOFU) blog — include copy + CRM import file (gated).
Repurpose: LinkedIn post with A/B tested subject lines and snippets.

Days 28–30: Buffer / CRO tasks

A/B test landing page for 90-day template; promote top posts via pinned LinkedIn and X posts; repost best-performing short clips.

Notes:

Each week: 2–3 social posts (one long-form LinkedIn + 1–2 short posts).

Time per publish (solo): ~6–10 hours for long-form + repurposes; shorts and carousels reused from blog assets.

6) Repurposing playbook (get maximal reach with minimal effort)
Master asset → derivatives: Create one long-form “master” (blog + long video). Convert to: newsletter, 1 LinkedIn long post, 1 carousel, 3–6 X tweets, 4 short-form videos (15–60s), and 1 infographic.

Templates & downloads: Always convert templates into gated assets (Notion/Sheets) and multiple formats (PDF + CSV + Notion). Each format is a fresh CTA.

Video chopping: From a 5–8 minute video produce 6× short clips (15–60s) each highlighting a single insight. Use captions and branded intro.

Thread → blog: Expand X threads that perform well into blogs; vice versa: condense blog into a thread.

Carousel → newsletter: Post LinkedIn carousels and then compile them into a “best of” newsletter issue.

SEO → Social: Use top Google search queries (from your pillar) to make quick Q&A social posts.

Syndication: Post shortened versions on Medium and republish on IndieHackers or relevant community forums with canonical links back to original.

Evergreen refresh: Quarterly update for pillar pages (add new tools, data, and links) — promotes a fresh social push.

Tactical growth & measurement rules
Primary KPI: email leads acquired per month (tie every gated CTA to this).

Secondary KPIs: organic traffic, demo calls (if BOFU), LinkedIn engagement, YouTube views (shorts).

Measurement habit: Every new piece gets a UTM-tagged promotion plan and a scoreboard (views, CTR to landing, leads) tracked weekly.

Minimum success threshold (first 90 days): 500 email leads OR 5k organic sessions on pillar content — whichever aligns with your model.

Quick content templates (copy snippets you can paste)
Blog intro hook (case study): “We set out to get 300 active users in 60 days. Here’s exactly what we tested, the metrics we tracked, and what scaled.”

LinkedIn post CTA: “If you want the template, DM me ‘90DAY’ or click the link — I’ll share it for free.”

Short video hook (0–3s): “Want your first 100 customers? Try this 7-step play.”

Example: Filled plan for Early-stage SaaS founders & growth marketers (Acme Labs / “Open Growth”)
Niche: early-stage SaaS founders & growth marketers

Goal: More leads & newsletter subscribers

Content types: Blog pillar + LinkedIn carousels + YouTube shorts + X threads

Cadence: 2 long-form posts/month + weekly short social posts (fits solo creator)

Pick two pillars for first 90 days:

Acquisition experiments (case studies, templates)

Platform playbooks (LinkedIn, SEO, email outreach)

Use the 30-day calendar above with topics: experiments, AI tools, 90-day plan, case study, outreach sequence.

Final checklist before you publish (5-minute launch checklist)
SEO meta (title, description, H1) done.

Lead magnet uploaded and CTA obvious above the fold.

UTM tags on all social links.

3 social derivative assets ready (thread, carousel, 1 short).

Analytics event tracked for “lead magnet download”.

If you want, I can now:

Convert the 30-day calendar into a week-by-week Google Calendar (exportable CSV), or

Produce the full First 90 Days Growth Plan blog draft (2k words) with headlines, subheads, and the downloadable template filled out.

Pick (1) or (2) or say “use [NEW NICHE] / [AUDIENCE] / [GOAL] / [CONTENT TYPES] / [TIME/RESOURCES]” and I’ll regenerate instantly.
