## Summary for Continuing the Project
We are exploring a new type of synthetic intelligence architecture different from today’s transformer-based cloud AI. The concept includes:

### 1. Conceptual Core
- Compact reasoning module.
- Stores rules, patterns, logic, formulas, and procedural understanding.
- Local, efficient reasoning.

### 2. Factual Memory Layer
- Stores exact knowledge verbatim.
- Uses vector store or signed knowledge packs.
- Prevents hallucinations.

### Combined Mind Structure
- Core = reasoning.
- Factual layer = exact recall.
- Orchestrator decides which to use.

### System Components
- Local AI runtime.
- Local vector DB.
- Symbolic/procedural modules.
- Optional cloud middleware.
- Privacy-first.
- Future hardware: small AI coprocessor chip.

### Long-term Vision
- Universal on-device AI brain.
- Low hardware dependency.
- Mind-like architecture.
- Path toward AGI-like lifelong learning.
