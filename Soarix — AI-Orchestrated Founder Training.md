## 📖 Day 1 — SEO Foundations

### 🌱 Concept — “Helping Google Understand You”

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** means making your website easier for Google to understand, so it recommends you when people search.

#### 🧩 Analogy
Google is like a giant **librarian**.  
If your website has:  
- a clear **title** (keyword)  
- a good **summary** (meta description)  
- well-organized **chapters** (headings and structure)  

…the librarian knows what your “book” is about and who should read it.

#### 💬 Industry Jargon
- **Keyword:** what people type into Google.  
- **On-page SEO:** optimizing your site’s text, titles, and images.  
- **Off-page SEO:** getting backlinks (votes from other sites).  
- **SERP:** Search Engine Results Page (the Google results list).

### ⚒️ Tool of the Day — *Ubersuggest*

**Link:** [https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest)

A free keyword research tool to discover what people are searching and how hard it is to rank.

#### 🪜 Steps:
1. Open the tool.
2. Type a topic (e.g., “best laptops under 50000 in India”).
3. Review:
   - **Search Volume** → number of monthly searches.  
   - **SEO Difficulty** → how hard it is to rank.  
   - **Keyword Ideas** → related searches you can use.

### 🧠 Practice Task (15–20 minutes)
1. Go to Ubersuggest.  
2. Search for a topic related to your **business or service idea**.  
   - e.g. “digital marketing for small business” or “AI tools for creators”.  
3. Pick **3 keywords** that have:  
   - **Medium difficulty**  
   - **500+ monthly searches**  
4. Save them — we’ll use these later for blog or website builds.
