**User:**  
What is figma? What is it's use? Qnd is it available to use it in ChatGPT?

**Assistant:**  
Figma is a digital drawing and design playground for making things like:

• Website designs  
• Mobile app screens  
• Logos and icons  
• Prototypes you can click and test  
• Team design projects where everyone can work together live

Imagine a giant whiteboard where your whole team can draw at the same time — that’s Figma. It runs in a web browser, so nothing to install.

Why people love it:
• Easy to learn  
• Made for teamwork  
• Designers and developers can see the same project  
• You can test how the app or website will feel before building it

Can you use Figma inside ChatGPT?  
Not directly.

But here’s what *can* happen:
• I can design layouts, components, and UX ideas here  
• Then I can export them as code, images, or design specs  
• You import those into Figma  
• I can suggest plugins and workflows you can apply inside Figma

ChatGPT + Figma works like:  
I help you think → You bring it into a design tool → We refine it again.

**User:**  
Outline the best way we cam use figma in our business in simple english to a 10 year old?

**Assistant:**  
Figma becomes the drawing table for Soarix.

1. First, we draw the idea.  
2. Everyone can look and help.  
3. We test how the design feels.  
4. Developers turn it into real apps/websites.  
5. We improve designs anytime.

Figma = draw → test → approve → build.  
This saves time, money, and makes clients happy.

**User:**  
So the front end can be designed using figma?

**Assistant:**  
Yes. Figma is where you design the frontend — how the website or app *looks* and *feels*.  
Developers later turn that design into real code.

**User:**  
Give me one simple example?

**Assistant:**  
Example: A To-Do app.

In Figma you draw:
• Title  
• Input box  
• Add button  
• List area  

Make it clickable → client tests → dev builds the real version.

**User:**  
What about website let's say for Soarix itself?

**Assistant:**  
For a Soarix website, Figma is used to draw the homepage:  
Hero section, menu, services, contact, etc.  
We test layout and animations → get feedback → finalize → developers build it.
