## 🧠 Conversation Summary

**Goal:**  
Create a Markdown (.md) record of the entire chat session — including context, uploaded references, and the *Master Prompt* template for building any Soarix project (websites, apps, SaaS, extensions, plugins, etc.).

### 1️⃣ Master Prompt — [PROJECT_NAME] (Complete)

The user provided the **Soarix universal product-building prompt** that defines scope, architecture, monetization, compliance, and scaling for any new project.

> **Purpose:**  
> A reusable “blueprint prompt” that can generate production-ready systems across all Soarix branches — combining backend, frontend, infrastructure, monetization, and legal compliance into a single workflow.

It includes:
- 12 structured sections covering architecture, tech stack, monetization, compliance, cost control, and scaling.
- A **5-step return framework**:  
  1. Backend  
  2. Frontend  
  3. Database & Infrastructure  
  4. Deployment & DevOps  
  5. Implementation Guide  
- Built-in rules for API cost control, GDPR/CCPA compliance, caching, fallback logic, and revenue mapping.

### 2️⃣ Uploaded Reference — “dev environment setup .pdf”:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Defines the **baseline Linux VM setup** for Soarix’s developer ecosystem, using:
- Ubuntu or Pop!_OS inside VirtualBox.  
- Tooling stack for Git, Node (NVM), Python (Pyenv), Docker, and AI utilities like **Ollama**, **Stable Diffusion**, and **Whisper**.  
- Security tools: UFW, Fail2Ban, KeePassXC, Falco, and Wazuh.  
- Monitoring stack: Prometheus + Grafana + Sentry.  
- Cloud/Infra: Render, Railway, Supabase, Firebase, Cloudflare, BunnyCDN.  
- Compliance: SOC2 alignment, encryption standards, and backup automation.  

This document serves as the foundation for all technical builds in Soarix OS and Soarix AI Orchestrator environments.

### 3️⃣ Uploaded Reference — “Soarix System Prompt V3.docx”:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

The **Soarix Executive Orchestrator System Prompt (Final + Revenue Edition)** defines how the AI operates as:
- Virtual CEO/CTO/Corporate Lawyer  
- Trainer for the user (a non-technical founder)  
- Compliance & production-readiness overseer

Core directives:
- Always explain like to a 10-year-old.  
- Require step-by-step confirmation before moving forward.  
- Never repeat failed instructions; always propose alternatives.  
- Cover every software layer (frontend → backend → infrastructure → security → monitoring → automation).  
- Suggest **free or low-cost, non-Israel-based** tools, safe for commercial use.  
- Integrate ethics, data compliance, and emotional UX design.  
- Every technical suggestion includes **Executive Insight** (why it matters, risk, legal note, success metric).

It links all Soarix branches:
- **Media** → marketing automation  
- **Studios** → visual & 3D workflows  
- **Publishing** → AI-assisted writing  
- **AI** → product & app development  
- **Nexus** → agent R&D, automation, innovation
