This is a course curriculum for ByteByteAI's Cohort 2, a 6-week cohort-based AI engineering program running from November 8 to December 14. It's a hands-on course designed to teach people how to become AI engineers through practical projects.

The course includes:

Project 1: Build an LLM Playground (covering pre-training, fine-tuning, RAG, etc.)
Project 2: Build a Customer Support Chatbot (prompt engineering, adapters)
Project 3: Build an "Ask-the-Web" Agent similar to Perplexity
Project 4: Build "Deep Research" Capability (reasoning LLMs)
Project 5: Build an Image Generation Service (VAE, GANs, diffusion models)
Project 6: Capstone Project (your own idea)
Plus modules on Agent/RAG patterns and MCP/A2A protocols.

As for whether I can do the same education - I'm Claude, an AI assistant, so I don't learn or enroll in courses. However, I can absolutely help you learn these topics! I can:

Explain AI engineering concepts
Help you build similar projects
Debug code and provide guidance
Answer questions about LLMs, agents, RAG, prompt engineering, etc.
Would you like help learning any of these topics or working on a project? I'm happy to be your AI engineering tutor!
