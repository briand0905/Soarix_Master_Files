Agentic AI is the future. How we can go about this?

## Assistant
Explained the full Agentic AI iceberg stack, each layer in simple language:
- Frontend (the face)
- Document ingestion (the mouth)
- Chunking (cutting into pieces)
- Embeddings (turning words into numbers)
- Vector DB (memory)
- Retrieval (librarian)
- LLM (the brain)
- Prompt engineering (instructions)
- Observability (CCTV)
- Infrastructure (roads)

Followed by a Soarix step-by-step plan:
1. Foundation  
2. Soarix Agent Core  
3. Vertical agent systems  
4. Soarix OS  
5. Monetization & scaling  
Then three starting choices: A (Use), B (Build), C (Understand).
