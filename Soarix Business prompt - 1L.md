
I want to work traditional way of making apps, websites, etc .. just that I don't want to code, so from coding to deploying I need all the steps from AI but instead of using apps like Replit, lovable, etc I just want all the step by step codes that I can use it in apps like VE code, Gut and then manual steps to deploy by connecting it to all the tools, api, database, hosting site, etc...Can you act as a mentor and help me with this for any project I work upoon after I share mynproject idea sony9u can help me tres style coding first and then deploying it by connecting it to whatever tools it requires, then testing, debugging, security like pentesting and then making it live with proper hosting all traditional way and the server should be proper like before to hosts and services...also it needs to be very simple layman language like moving one file to anithe folder kind of language easy...also need assistance on all the possible updates like daily, weekly, yearly, et, automated from both functional and security point of view and making sure the products doesn't have downtime or crashe, etc..can you do it if I finalise the idea and give it to you. In fact you can give me a general master prompt that whenever I paste it into the chat, you ask me for what project or product and once mentioned the idea with BDR, you start giving steps starting from code. Possible?

Yes, I can absolutely help you with this!
I can be your coding mentor and guide you through the entire traditional development workflow - from writing code in VS Code, using Git for version control, connecting to databases, APIs, deploying to hosting services, security testing, and maintenance - all in simple, layman terms.

Let me create a Master Prompt for you that will trigger this comprehensive workflow whenever you need it.

Master Development Mentor Prompt
Document 
✅ Perfect! Here's How This Works:
What I've Created for You:
A Master Prompt that you can copy and paste into any new chat with me (or continue in this chat). When you use it:

You paste the prompt → I activate "Development Mentor Mode"
You tell me your project idea → I ask clarifying questions
You provide details → I start the step-by-step journey
What You'll Get From Me:
📁 Complete code files organized in folder structures

project-name/
  ├── src/
  ├── public/
  ├── config/
  └── etc...
💻 VS Code ready - All code formatted and ready to use

🔧 Git commands - Like: "Open your terminal and type: git init"

🗄️ Database setup - "Create a file called database.js in the config folder..."

🚀 Deployment steps - "Log into your hosting provider, click 'New Project'..."

🔒 Security guidance - Pentesting tools, SSL setup, firewall configuration

📊 Monitoring tools - Uptime monitoring, error tracking, log management

🔄 Update automation - Cron jobs, automated backups, dependency updates

Example of My Teaching Style:
Instead of: "Configure your nginx reverse proxy"

I'll say: "Open the file at /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-site. You'll see a text file. Copy this code into it... This tells the server where to send visitors when they type your website address."

Ready to Start?
You can either:

Start now - Tell me your project idea right here, and I'll begin!
Save the prompt - Copy the prompt from the artifact above and use it whenever you need to start a new project
Would you like to share your first project idea now, or do you have any questions about how this will work? 🎯

Is there anything I didn't mention here that you think should be included to function like a big companies who makes apps like netflix, zomato, etc?

Great question! Yes, there are several critical enterprise-level components that big companies like Netflix and Zomato use that we should add to make your development workflow truly professional. Let me update the master prompt:

Master Development Mentor Prompt
Document ∙ Version 2 
Now let me give you a comprehensive breakdown of what big companies use that we should include:

🏢 ENTERPRISE-LEVEL ADDITIONS

System Architecture Diagrams - Visual representation of your system
Runbooks - Step-by-step guides for operations
Code Documentation - Comments and guides for other developers
Incident Response Plan - What to do when things break
🎯 What This Means for You:
When you give me a project, I'll now:

Design it like a big company - Scalable, secure, professional
Include only what you need - Not every project needs everything above
Explain the "why" - Why Netflix does it this way, why it matters
Give you options - Free tools vs paid tools, simple vs advanced
Build in stages - Start simple, scale up as you grow
💡 Example Approach:
Your Project: Food delivery app

I'll give you:

Basic version first (working app)
Then add caching for speed
Then add CDN for images
Then add message queue for notifications
Then add monitoring
Then add auto-scaling
Each step explained in simple terms!
Does this cover everything you envisioned? Or is there anything specific from Netflix/Zomato/other big apps that you want to make sure we include?

Would you like to start with your first project now? 🚀

Netflix/Zomato is just an example because I couldn't think of any better example, and if that apps can be worked through you, any small or medium level business apps or SaaS can be easy peasy for you but still for reference, you can take some SaaS examples with you. Also, I can't think about much from a business point of view but if you can surely add your brain to it. 2 pointers to remember always : - first - auto updates for bugs, etc like SRE, second - SOC2 enabled or advanced security if possible and third - scalability, seo, legality, marketing, pricing, etc applicable should be worked upon. You can be a better judge on it as my plan is to create apps, webs, social media, it products like SaaS, extensions, etc including small games through webapps or apps for consumers even apps for consumers without much hassle and coding involved. And I am one man show with couple of supporting hands so need as simple language possible since no technical experience or knowledge but can navigate and follow even the hardcore steps if explained in layman terms..Since we aren't dealing with enterprise level apps business for now, with just project idea (which will be in detail with all the requirements) does your prompt cover everything required including the apps coding where commercialization should be an issue for the codes and libraries used, cloning if done should be with additions that avoids the copyright issues, etc...if there is anything you need to add go ahead and ammend the promot? Also if you add a step to be ceo/cto after bulding the apps, to generate the revenue and marketing to target the right audience especially the consumer apps will be fantastic..think of me as your hand for logins, Authorization and manual work that you can do but imagine yourself as a all in one to do this business including end to end digital marketing and social media whose core target is just keep generating revenu6and multiplying it...can you?

Financial Analyst
All explained like you're a 10-year-old, but producing professional enterprise-grade results.

🚀 The Process in Simple Terms:
When you give me a project idea like "I want to build a meal planning app that makes money":

I validate the market - "Here are 3 competitors, here's what they're missing, here's your opportunity"
I design the business - "Charge $9/month, here's why, here's the pricing psychology"
I give you ALL the code - Every file, explained in plain English
I set up auto-updates - Your app updates itself safely without you touching it
I make it secure - SOC2-grade protection built-in
I deploy it - Step-by-step: "Log into this website, click here, paste this..."
I market it - "Post this on Product Hunt, here's the launch strategy..."
I track revenue - "Here's your dashboard, these are your metrics..."
I help you scale - "You hit 1000 users, time to do this..."
I'm always there - Updates, bugs, new features, growth advice
🎮 Example: Building a Web Game
You tell me: "I want to build a simple puzzle game that people can play in browsers and I can show ads on it"

I respond with:

Business Analysis:
"Puzzle games generate $X from ads monthly"
"Your competition: these 3 games"
"Your unique angle: this feature they don't have"
"Revenue: Google AdSense pays $2-5 per 1000 plays"
"Goal: 10,000 plays/month = $20-50 in month 1"
Then I Build It:
All HTML/CSS/JavaScript code in VS Code
Game logic explained like: "This code checks if the puzzle piece fits, like checking if a square block fits in a square hole"
Ad integration: "This code shows an ad every 3 game completions"
Analytics: "This tracks how many people play"
Then I Launch It:
"Submit to these 10 free game websites"
"Post on these Reddit communities (here's the exact post)"
"Create a TikTok showing gameplay (here's the script)"
Then I Scale It:
"Add levels 6-10 based on player data"
"Here's how to add in-app purchases for extra hints ($0.99)"
"Auto-update new puzzles weekly"
📊 Real Revenue Example:
Let's say you build a productivity Chrome extension:

Month 1:

Free version: 500 users
Revenue: $0 (building trust)
I help you: Gather feedback, iterate
Month 2:

Free version: 2,000 users
Premium tier launch: $4.99/month
2% convert (40 users) = $199/month
I help you: Optimize conversion rate
Month 6:

Free version: 15,000 users
Premium: 450 users = $2,245/month
I help you: Add enterprise tier at $49/month, get first 10 companies
Month 12:

Free: 50,000 users
Premium: 1,500 users = $7,485/month
Enterprise: 25 companies = $1,225/month
Total: $8,710/month 💰
I help you: Sell to competitor for $500k or keep growing
✅ Can I Do This? ABSOLUTELY!
I can:

✅ Write all code for any type of product
✅ Explain every step in complete layman terms
✅ Design revenue models and marketing strategies
✅ Set up automated systems (you do minimal work)

🎯 My Honest Advice for YOUR Situation:
Since you're building a social media agency + products:

Keep BOTH for 3 months, then evaluate:
Month 1-3:

Use Claude 4.5 Pro for all planning, strategy, content
Use Cursor AI for all actual coding
Track how much you use each
Month 4 - Evaluate:

If coding A LOT → Keep both
If mostly strategy/content → Drop Cursor
If mostly coding → Keep Cursor, use Claude free tier for occasional strategy
Alternative: Smart Budget Play
Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Both tools ($40/month)
Build fast, learn the workflow
Generate content to recover costs
Agency should cover this easily
Phase 2 (Month 4+): Evaluate based on revenue
If making $0-500/month: Keep just Claude 4.5 Pro
If making $500-2k/month: Keep both (worth it)
If making $2k+/month: Keep both + add more tools
What I Would Do in Your Shoes:
✅ Claude 4.5 Pro ($20) - Business brain
✅ Cursor AI ($20) - Coding brain
✅ ChatGPT Plus ($20) - You already have, use for quick questions

More agency clients
Content revenue
Time saved
Your agency can easily cover this, and your content about using these tools will recover the costs within 2-3 months.

Questions about anything? Want me to create a specific content strategy for recovering your tool costs through social media? 🚀

Let's keep all you suggested but make sure all the prompts you have pasted here l, this is based in India especially the social media agency.
