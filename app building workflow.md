   (each with KPI targets)

#### **13️⃣ Risk Checklist**

| Risk        | Mitigation                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| No installs | DM communities, adjust keywords       |
| No revenue  | Add ads, lower price                  |
| Tech issues | Rebuild via Expo, use fallback prompt |

Ten copy-paste items (build prompts, UI prompt, Play Store/Whop copy, TikTok post, KPI target).

### 5. No-Social-Media Distribution Strategy

Since Brian lacks personal social accounts:

* Focus on **borrowed audiences** (Discord/Telegram admins, small creators).
* **Marketplaces first:** Whop, Gumroad, Fiverr.
* **Organic discovery:** Play Store SEO (“loan calculator”, “unit converter”).
* **Affiliate model:** give creators free Pro codes to promote.

### 6. Execution Pattern Agreed

> “Whenever I say *let’s go*, you start with idea → build → publish → monetize → track until done.”

Next cycles will each start with GPT-5 proposing a new **validated idea** (niche utility or AI tool) and running through the full process.

---

## 🧭 Next Step

When Brian types **“let’s go”**, GPT-5 will:

1. Present 1–2 validated app ideas (ready for build).
2. Guide build → package → deploy → monetize → track until live and earning.
