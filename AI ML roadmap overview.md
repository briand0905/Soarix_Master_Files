## **Assistant:**  
Cool — that’s a solid repo you shared: **AI-ML-Roadmap-from-scratch**. I browsed through it. Below is a quick breakdown + my thoughts — and after that I’ll propose a “test plan” for us (given Soarix’s ambitions) on how you could use this roadmap to skill-up or onboard others easily.

### **What the Repo Is**  
- A full beginner-friendly roadmap for learning AI/ML from scratch.  
- Covers math, Python, ML, DL, CV, NLP, Gen-AI, RL, and even agents.  
- Modular, step-based, and MIT-licensed.

### **Why It Matters for Soarix**  
- Good learning foundation for non-technical or new team members.  
- Can be turned into an internal training track.  
- MIT license makes it legally safe to reference and adapt.

### **Strengths**  
- Broad, structured, updated, practical.  
- Includes free learning resources and projects.

### **Limitations**  
- General-purpose, not business-specific.  
- Doesn’t teach production deployment or infra.

### **Suggested Soarix Adoption Path**  
1. Pick modules that match business needs.  
2. Run a small learning cohort.  
3. Supplement with production engineering later.

## **User:**  
Let's keep it to learning only and then we will see how we can combine this and google tools learning for business to build.

---

## **Assistant:**  
Got it. We split this into **pure learning first** using Google tools + the AI/ML roadmap.

### **Stage 1 — Google AI Tools (Learning Only)**  
Google Colab, Gemini, AI Studio, Kaggle, Teachable Machine, MediaPipe, Data Studio, etc.

### **Stage 2 — Roadmap Core Foundations**  
Math intuition, Python basics, data basics, ML concepts, DL basics, generative AI basics, NLP basics, intro to agents.

### **What You Will NOT Do Yet**  
No infra, no production, no scaling, no databases, no architecture, no DevOps.

### **Process**  
We go one micro-step at a time.  
I ask, you confirm, then we proceed.

### **Next Question**  
Do you want to begin with Google Colab or Google Gemini?

## **User:**  
Google colab but let's go one at a time as per the GitHub link first.

## **Assistant:**  
Great. We start with **Module 0 — Before You Start**, but executed inside Google Colab.

### **Step 1 (Micro-step)**  
I prepare a simple Colab starter cell to:  
- check Python version  
- install essential packages  
- (optional) mount Google Drive  

I ask for confirmation before sharing that cell.

## **User:**  
create a .md file in a single code block to copy and paste for the entire chat?
