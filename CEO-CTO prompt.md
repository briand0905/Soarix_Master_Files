# AI-Native Solo Dev Studio: Infrastructure-Free Playbook (India-Based, Global Clients)

*CEO + CTO + Legal + Security + Finance + Growth Plan for a 100% AI-Assisted, Zero-Infrastructure Tech Business*

---

## ✅ OVERARCHING PRINCIPLES (Non-Negotiable)
1. **You are a contractor, not a data processor or SaaS provider** → No custody, no storage, no liability for client data.
2. **All infrastructure is client-owned** → You never create or own cloud accounts.
3. **AI = assistant, not owner** → All output is human-reviewed, validated, and documented.
4. **Compliance = advisory only** → Never claim certification; always say “readiness guidance.”
5. **Margin protection** → Fixed-price projects + clear scope guardrails + 50% upfront.

---

## 1. LEGAL, COMPLIANCE & RISK MITIGATION

### 🏢 Best Indian Entity: Private Limited Company (Pvt Ltd)
- **Why**: Global credibility, limited liability, foreign currency accounts, GST, enforceable contracts.
- **Where**: Register in Delhi, Mumbai, or Bangalore.
- **Timeline**: 7–10 days via [MCA Portal](https://www.mca.gov.in).
- **Cost**: ₹8,000–₹15,000 (via LegalRaasta, Vakilsearch, or CA).

> ✅ **Action Checklist – Day 1–3**  
> - [ ] Choose company name (e.g., “Nexus Labs Pvt Ltd”)  
> - [ ] Get DSC for directors  
> - [ ] File SPICe+ (INC-32) on MCA portal  
> - [ ] Open current account (Kotak/Axis/ICICI)  
> - [ ] Register for GST (optional <₹20L revenue)

### 📄 Essential Legal Docs (AI-Drafted + Lawyer-Reviewed)
- Use AI (Claude/Copilot) → Indian startup lawyer review (~₹5k–10k)

#### **Master Services Agreement (MSA) – Core Clauses**
```text
1. Engagement: Independent contractor.
2. IP Ownership: Client owns 100% upon full payment. Developer retains no rights.
3. Data Handling: No collection, storage, or processing of personal data.
4. Liability Cap: Capped at fees paid.
5. Exclusions: Not liable for (a) third-party outages, (b) client misconfigurations, (c) software misuse.
6. Jurisdiction: Exclusive courts in [City, e.g., Mumbai], India. Arbitration under 1996 Act.
```

#### **Statement of Work (SOW) – Per Project**
```markdown

#### **DPA Strategy**
- Avoid if possible. If required:  
  > “This engagement does not involve processing of personal data. Developer is not a data processor under GDPR/CCPA.”

- **Service**: Read-only dashboard review + PDF report.
- **Deliverable**: “Enable 2FA”, “Set up UptimeRobot”, etc.
- **Disclaimer**:  
  > “This service does not constitute compliance certification. Client remains solely responsible.”

### 📜 Professional Indemnity Insurance (India)

3. “SRE Lite”: Client shares **UptimeRobot dashboard link** → you generate monthly PDF.
4. “SOC 2 Readiness”: AI-generated gap analysis → actionable suggestions only.
