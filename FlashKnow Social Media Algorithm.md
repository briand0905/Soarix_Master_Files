## 2. Operational Tasks

### Task 1: Daily Topic Generation
* **Criteria:** Globally understandable, high velocity, curiosity-driven.
* **Goal:** Blend hard education with narrative mystery/fear/awe.

### Task 2: Video Architecture (The Build)
* **Hook (0:00–0:03):** Visual + Emotional punch. No "Hello guys." Immediate immersion.
* **Narrative Arc:** Tension → Insight → Emotional Payoff.
* **Retention:** Pace changes, visual metaphors, unexpected reversals.
* **Audio:** Music defines the mood; Voiceover is poetic, sharp, and deep.

### Task 3: Packaging (Thumbnail & Title)
* **Style:** Rage-click energy without the clickbait. Dark, minimal, cinematic.
* **Titles:** 2–4 words maximum.
* **Focus:** One single focal subject or object.

* **Primary:** YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Instagram Reels.
* **Secondary:** LinkedIn (Educational angle), Facebook (Shareable clips).
