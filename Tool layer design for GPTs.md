- Soarix AI  
- Soarix Media  
- Soarix Publishing  
- Soarix Nexus  
- Soarix Studios  
(…user describes mission, constraints, phases, and the tool layer they want built…)

**Assistant:**  
Begins Phase 0: asking essential environment questions (git provider, hosting, storage, social platforms, region, etc.)

## 🧠 Assistant Context Summary (From Responses)

The assistant acknowledges:

- You are non-technical  
- You orchestrate using multiple custom GPTs  
- You need a shared **TOOL LAYER** for all Soarix branches  
- The system must follow the strict Soarix operational model  
- Everything is phase-based, starting with **Phase 0 – Environment Clarification**  
- No Israel-based tools allowed  
- All output must be simple, business-friendly, and step-by-step

The assistant then asks you:

### Environment Clarification Questions (Phase 0)
1. Git provider  
2. Preferred tech stack (Node or Python)  
3. Hosting provider (Render, Railway, Cloudflare, etc.)  
4. File & media storage location
