# Soarix Solutions — Agents, Offline AI, and No-API Factory Setup  
**Date:** 2025-12-06  
**Conversation Summary:** Guidance for running Soarix Solutions using ChatGPT Plus and Gemini Pro without API integrations.  
**Format:** Single-line, actionable steps for learning, building, and orchestrating Soarix AI systems.

---

## 1️⃣ What is an Agent? How to Build It? Why It Matters for Soarix

1. Agent = AI that takes goals, uses tools/data, and acts autonomously.  
2. Pick an engine: ChatGPT (OpenAI) or local model (Llama, Mistral).  
3. Install framework: LangChain, LlamaIndex, or CrewAI.  
4. Create one skill per agent (research, design, writing, etc.).  
5. Give it access to Soarix data or APIs (securely).  
6. Connect to your front-end (chat, dashboard, or app).  
7. Automate Soarix tasks — content, reports, design, or code.  
8. Save each working agent as a Soarix “Service Unit” under its branch.

---

## 2️⃣ Offline AI + MCP Setup

1. Offline AI = models like Llama 3 or Mistral run locally.  
2. Install Ollama or LM Studio for local model control.  
3. Add MCP Server to organize data, tools, and model access.  
4. Connect agents to MCP so they query data safely.  
5. Use offline AI for private or sensitive client work.  
6. Combine offline + online = hybrid system (privacy + power).  
7. Maintain on dedicated Soarix Nexus machine.

## 3️⃣ ChatGPT + Gemini Pro Only (No API) for Soarix

1. Main intelligence: ChatGPT for reasoning, Gemini for data/search.  
2. Create manual MCP docs (Google Drive / Notion) per client/project.  
3. Copy that doc as context into ChatGPT or Gemini chat.  
4. Build Custom GPTs for each Soarix branch (Media, Studios, Publishing, AI, Nexus).  
5. Use Gemini Labs workspace for dataset and workflow analysis.  
6. Use ChatGPT threads for reasoning; Gemini threads for data grounding.  
7. Chain prompts manually (plan → draft → refine → publish).  
8. Store all project histories in Drive/Notion as your MCP archive.

## 4️⃣ Best Tools (ChatGPT & Gemini Labs)

1. ChatGPT Custom GPTs → build branded assistants.  
2. Gemini Labs Workbench → experiment with structured reasoning.  
3. Google AI Studio + Firebase → deploy internal mini apps.  
4. Vercel + Next.js → host dashboards or knowledge hubs.  
5. Replit / GitHub Copilot → assisted coding.  
6. Framer + Gemini Design Lab → instant UI & site prototypes.  
7. Use ChatGPT for creative logic; Gemini for data & research.

## 5️⃣ Building AI, Agents, MCPs, LLMs/SLMs, and 3D Systems

1. Choose base models (GPT-4, Gemini, Llama, Mistral).  
2. For tuning → OpenPipe, Hugging Face, or Ollama.  
3. For 3D + design → Blender + AI plugins, Runway ML.  
4. For web front-ends → Next.js + Vercel.  
5. For automations → n8n, LangChain, CrewAI.  
6. For video/image gen → Pika Labs, Kaiber, Leonardo AI.  
7. Assign per branch:  
 – Media = creative AI  
 – Studios = UI/3D  
 – Publishing = content AI  
 – AI = apps & agents  
 – Nexus = R&D and offline AI.

## 6️⃣ Running Soarix Solutions as a Business (Factory Model)

1. Centralize all branches in Notion + ClickUp + n8n (workflow hub).  
2. Give each branch its own AI Factory:  
 – Media → Social + Marketing Suite  
 – Studios → 3D/UI Generator  
 – Publishing → Book/Blog Automation  
 – AI → Agent Builder Suite  
 – Nexus → R&D Lab.  
3. Use ChatGPT and Gemini Pro directly (no API) to power each suite.  
4. Tools: Buffer / Metricool / Publer for social posting.  
5. Automate workflows using chat threads + browser automation.  
6. Connect factories via shared Drive or Notion knowledge base.  
7. Track KPIs (engagement, leads, turnaround time) weekly.

## 7️⃣ No-API Method (ChatGPT Plus + Gemini Pro Only)

1. Create a shared **Soarix Context Drive** with SOPs, prompts, datasets.  
2. Store reusable **Prompt Templates** per task (write, plan, design).  
3. Build **Custom GPTs** for Soarix roles using those templates.  
4. Mirror each in **Gemini Workspaces** for cross-verification.  
5. Maintain **MCP Docs** in Drive/Notion – project summaries, tools, data.  
6. Paste that MCP context manually into chats before prompting.  
7. Chain prompts manually for stepwise reasoning.  
8. Keep separate chat threads per client/project for context memory.  
9. Use **snippet managers** for fast template insertion.  
10. Use **UI automation tools** (Ui.Vision, Make.com) for repetitive inputs.  
11. Maintain a **human review gate** before client delivery.  
12. Track **versions + changelogs** in Drive/Notion.  
13. Keep secrets in a password vault (never paste in chat).  
14. Draft locally, paste sanitized context online for safety.  
15. Train team with short screencast SOPs on prompt usage.  
16. Delegate to operators + editors per branch once stable.  
17. Track impact KPIs (time saved, output count, client revisions).  
18. Update templates & MCP docs weekly from best outputs.  
19. Export important chat threads to Drive for record.  
20. Plan future API migration when ready for full automation.

## 8️⃣ Soarix-Style Business Notes

- Keep the system human-centered; AI is support, not replacement.  
- Hybrid approach = online ChatGPT & Gemini Pro for intelligence + offline AI for privacy.  
- Each branch = a mini factory with clear inputs, outputs, and metrics.  
- Maintain compliance (GDPR, DPDP) by keeping sensitive data local.  
- Regularly review templates and context drives for consistency.  
- Build a culture of iteration — document, refine, scale.
