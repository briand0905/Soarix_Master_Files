# 6. SHARED WORKFLOW — HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS  

### 1. Ingestion  
- CyberWall: device scans, browser events, file metadata  
- Sentinel: syslogs, cloud logs, firewall logs, endpoint logs  

### 2. Normalization  
Everything becomes structured JSON.

### 3. Detection Workflow
1. **Rule-based checks**  
2. **Behavior analysis**  
3. **LLM threat interpretation**  
4. **Embeddings similarity check**  
5. **Severity scoring**

### 4. Response
- Consumer: quarantine/delete + guide user  
- Enterprise: automated playbooks + approvals  

### 5. Explanation Engine
LLM produces:
- what happened  
- how dangerous it is  
- what the user should do  
- plain English output  

### 6. Dashboards
- CyberWall → app UI  
- Sentinel → web dashboard
