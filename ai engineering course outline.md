## AI Engineering — Structured Learning Path

### **Level 0 – Foundations (Prep Stage)**
- **Mathematics & Statistics**
  - Linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistical inference
- **Basic Programming & Software Engineering**
  - Git, unit testing, CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker)
- **Data Engineering Essentials**
  - ETL pipelines, SQL, data modeling, ingestion tools, batch vs streaming
- **Cloud Fundamentals & Infrastructure**
  - Cloud compute/storage (AWS/GCP/Azure), virtualization, networking basics

---

### **Level 1 – Using AI**
- **Prompt Engineering**
  - Zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting
- **Working with AI APIs**
  - Calling LLM APIs, embeddings, token limits, rate-limits, cost management

---

### **Level 2 – Model-Oriented Engineering**
- **Understanding Pre-trained and Fine-tuned Models**
  - GPT, BERT, and other architectures; capabilities vs limitations
- **Fine-tuning**
  - Learning rate, epochs, LoRA, adapter tuning, overfitting vs underfitting
- **Evaluation**
  - Model metrics, validation datasets, reproducibility, version control

---

### **Level 3 – Custom Architectures & Integration**
- **Designing AI Architectures**
  - Model chaining, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), multimodal fusion
- **System Integration**
  - API orchestration, pipelines, and microservice communication
- **Infrastructure Scaling**
  - GPU/TPU optimization, inference latency, load balancing

---

### **Level 4 – Frontier Models & Hardware Awareness**
- **Frontier Models**
  - GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, and open-source agent frameworks
- **Hardware Optimization**
  - Quantization, pruning, distillation, on-device inference, energy efficiency
- **Performance & Cost Trade-offs**
  - Scaling strategy, optimization frameworks (ONNX, TensorRT)

---

### **Level 5 – Strategy, Systems, and Ethics**
- **Ethics, Bias, and Safety**
  - Hallucinations, interpretability, bias mitigation, fairness frameworks
- **AI Strategy & Governance**
  - Business alignment, ROI, compliance (GDPR, CCPA, DPDP), risk management
- **Operational Maturity**
  - Experiment tracking, model registry, observability, continuous monitoring

---

## **Bonus Curriculum Additions**
- **Tooling Ecosystem**
  - MLflow, Weights & Biases, Hugging Face, LangChain, LlamaIndex
- **Security & Privacy**
  - Differential privacy, encryption, secure cloud setups
- **Governance & Team Collaboration**
  - Model cards, reproducibility, documentation, peer review
- **Capstone Project**
  - Prompt-based → Fine-tuned → Custom AI pipeline → Deployment → Ethical audit
