
You are now acting as a Senior Agency CEO, Marketing Strategist, and Creative Director for my freelance digital agency that provides services like website development, app/webapp creation, social media marketing, graphic design, SEO, branding, and offline marketing.

🎯 GOAL:
Help me create a *complete client requirement capture system* (for phone calls or client visits) that my sales or BDR rep can use to understand a client’s needs in one go — without needing multiple follow-ups.

👥 CONTEXT:
We work mostly with Indian clients (local businesses, startups, small brands). The language must be simple, friendly, and easy to understand (like explaining to a 10-year-old). The rep will spend 15–20 minutes on the call or in person filling the form while speaking with the client.

🧩 YOUR TASK:
Generate a complete and professional **Client Requirement Discovery Kit**, which includes:

1️⃣ A friendly **call/meeting script** for the rep to follow (step-by-step, natural conversation flow, not robotic).
2️⃣ A clear and detailed **Client Requirement Form Template** with sections for:
   - Basic Information  
   - Business/Brand Details  
   - Services Required  
   - Design & Content Preferences  
   - Target Audience & Goals  
   - Budget & Timeline  
   - Marketing Strategy (optional CEO insight section)  
   - Additional Notes / Files
3️⃣ Add natural **agency-level conversation lines** that make the rep sound smart, confident, and trustworthy (like a real marketing consultant, not a salesperson).
4️⃣ Add a short **next-steps and closing checklist** so that after the call, the rep knows what to send or do next.
5️⃣ Add a **CEO’s Bonus Section** – short advisory lines or insights that can be used by the rep to position the agency as strategic, not just technical.
6️⃣ Suggest the **best format(s)** for collecting this data (Google Form, Sheet, or PDF) and why.

💬 IMPORTANT:
- Use very simple Indian-English wording (easy to read and explain).  
- Include all possible services (websites, apps, social media, SEO, graphics, branding, print, etc.).  
- Make it detailed enough that once this form is filled, the design or tech team can start work without extra calls.  
- Structure it cleanly with section headers, checkboxes, and example answers where possible.  
- End with a suggestion if I want to generate a Google Sheet or Printable version next.

Now generate the full detailed output with all sections, ready for use.

For Indian Freelance Digital Agency
📞 PART 1: CALL/MEETING SCRIPT (Natural Conversation Flow)
Opening (30 seconds)
"Hello [Name]! Thank you so much for connecting with us. I'm [Your Name] from [Agency Name]. We help businesses like yours grow online through websites, apps, social media, and marketing.

I have around 15-20 minutes with you today, and my goal is to understand your business and what you're looking for, so we can give you the perfect solution. Sound good?"

[Wait for response, build rapport]

Stage 1: Understanding Their Business (3-4 minutes)
Script:

"Let me start by understanding your business a bit better..."

Ask naturally:

"So what does your business do? Tell me about your products or services."
"How long have you been running this business?"
"Do you currently have a website or social media presence? If yes, what's the link?"
"Who are your main customers? (Example: young professionals, housewives, students, corporate clients, etc.)"
Rep Note: Listen actively. Take notes. Show genuine interest.

Stage 2: What Do They Need? (5-6 minutes)
Script:

"Great! Now let me understand what exactly you're looking for from us today..."

Ask clearly:

"What service are you mainly interested in? Is it a website, app, social media marketing, branding, or something else?"
If Website:

"What kind of website? Business/portfolio, e-commerce (online shop), or booking/service-based?"
"Do you have any reference websites you like? Any specific features you want?"
If Social Media Marketing:

"Which platforms? Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube?"
"Do you want us to create content, post regularly, run ads, or all of it?"
If Branding/Logo:

"Are you starting fresh or redesigning?"
"Any colors, style, or feeling you want? (modern, traditional, colorful, minimal)"
If SEO/Ads:

"What's your main goal? More website visitors, calls, sales, or brand awareness?"
Rep Smart Line:

"Based on what you're sharing, I can already see 2-3 things that will really help your business grow. Let me note everything down properly."

Stage 3: Design & Content Preferences (3-4 minutes)
Script:

"Now let's talk about the look and feel..."

Ask:

"Do you have a logo already? What about brand colors?"
"Any competitors or brands whose design you admire?"
"Will you provide the content (text, photos, videos) or do you want us to create it?"
Rep Smart Line:

"Don't worry if you don't have everything ready. We help clients create content from scratch all the time. We'll guide you through it."

Stage 4: Goals, Audience & Budget (4-5 minutes)
Script:

"Let me understand your goals and who you want to reach..."

Ask:

"What's your main goal with this project? More customers, better brand image, online sales, or something else?"
"Who is your ideal customer? (Age, location, profession, income level)"
"Do you have a budget in mind for this project?"
Budget Handling (Smart Rep Line):

"I understand budget is important. Let me know a comfortable range, and I'll suggest the best options that give you maximum value. We work with businesses of all sizes."

Timeline:

"When would you ideally like this to be ready?"
"Is there any urgent reason (event, launch, festival season)?"
Stage 5: CEO Insight Drop (2 minutes) — Position as Consultant
Script:

"You know, [Name], based on what you've told me, I see a great opportunity here. Many businesses in [their industry] are moving online, and the ones who start now have a big advantage.

From an agency perspective, I would suggest [pick one]:

Starting with a strong website + social media presence together
Running a 3-month social media campaign first to build audience, then launching your website
Focusing on local SEO so people in [city] can find you on Google easily
But don't worry, we'll give you a proper plan and proposal based on everything we discussed today."

Rep Note: This makes you sound like a marketing expert, not just an order-taker.

Closing (2 minutes)
Script:

"Perfect! I have everything I need. Let me quickly summarize what we discussed:

You need [service]
Target audience is [audience]
Budget around [range]
Timeline is [timeline]
Here's what happens next:

I'll send you a detailed proposal within [24-48 hours]
We'll include pricing, timeline, and exactly what we'll deliver
Once you approve, we'll start with a kickoff meeting
Does that sound good? Any questions before we wrap up?"

Final Smart Line:

"We're really excited to work with you, [Name]. I can already see this being a great partnership. I'll stay in touch via WhatsApp. Thank you for your time!"

After the call/meeting, the rep should:

 Send a thank you message on WhatsApp within 1 hour
 Share agency portfolio/past work samples relevant to their need
 Send proposal with pricing & timeline within 24-48 hours
 Schedule proposal discussion call (if needed)
 Add client to CRM/follow-up system
 Set reminder for follow-up if no response in 3 days
WhatsApp Thank You Template:

"Hi [Name]! Thank you for your time today. It was great learning about [Business Name]. We're working on a detailed proposal for you and will share it by [Date]. Meanwhile, here's a quick look at similar work we've done: [Link]. Feel free to call/message anytime. Looking forward to working together! 😊"

🎓 PART 4: CEO'S BONUS SECTION
Smart Lines to Sound Like a Strategic Consultant
Use these during the call to build trust and authority:

When Discussing Budget:
"We work with businesses at all stages. The key is not how much you spend, but spending it on the right things that actually bring results."

When Client is Confused:
"Let me simplify this for you. Think of it like building a house. You need a strong foundation (website), then the interiors (design/content), and then you invite people in (marketing). We'll guide you step by step."

When Discussing Timeline:
"Good marketing takes time to show results, but smart marketing shows quick wins along the way. We'll build your project in phases so you start seeing value early."

When They Mention Competitors:
"It's great that you're aware of your competition. But here's the thing - we won't just copy them. We'll find what makes YOU different and highlight that. That's how you win."

When They're Price-Sensitive:
"I completely understand. Many of our best clients started with a smaller package and then scaled up when they saw results. Let's find what works for your current stage."

When Discussing Social Media:
"Social media isn't just about posting. It's about creating conversations with your audience. Anyone can post, but we create content that makes people stop scrolling and take action."

When They're Skeptical:
"That's a fair concern. Let me show you exactly how we've helped businesses like yours. Results speak louder than promises."

📊 PART 5: BEST FORMAT RECOMMENDATION
Recommended Format: Google Forms + Google Sheets Combo
Why This Works Best:

Google Form (For Client-Facing):

✅ Easy to fill on phone during call
✅ Professional look
✅ Automatically saves to Google Sheets

✅ Client can upload files directly
✅ Free and accessible anywhere
Google Sheets (For Internal Use):

✅ All responses organized automatically
✅ Entire team can access and update
✅ Easy to filter, sort, search

Alternative: Printable PDF

Use for in-person meetings where client prefers physical forms
Looks more professional for high-ticket clients
Rep fills by hand, then digitizes later
Hybrid Approach (Best):

Create Google Form as primary tool
Have PDF version for offline/print scenarios
Keep everything synced to one Google Sheet master database
