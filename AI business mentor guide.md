# 📘 **DAY 1 — What Is This Business About?**

### 🎯 Goal
Understand who you sell to, what problems you solve, what services you can package, which no-code / AI tools you’ll need, a simple client-to-delivery workflow, costs & timelines, and how to start selling outcomes — not features.

## 1️⃣ What You’re Really Selling
You are an **AI Orchestrator** — someone who combines **no-code tools + AI models** to deliver **business outcomes** (websites, e-commerce, bots, campaigns, apps, automation).  
Clients hire you because you deliver **results** (more leads, more revenue, less manual work) — not because you “use AI.”

## 2️⃣ Ideal Clients (India focused + 30 % Global)

## 3️⃣ Common Problems They Face

You solve all of this with **repeatable AI + no-code playbooks**.
