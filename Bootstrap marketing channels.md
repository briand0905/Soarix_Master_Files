Great question 👍 Let’s break this down step by step in plain, simple words.

🟢 What does “Bootstrap” mean?
When a startup says they are bootstrapped, it means:

They didn’t take outside money (no investors, no venture capital).

They used their own money, savings, or revenue to grow the business.

They grew step by step, carefully reinvesting profits back into the business.

👉 In short: self-funded growth without investors.

🟢 What is this post about?
The person is sharing how their SaaS (software-as-a-service) startup:

Launched 7 years ago.

Grew to 320,000 users.

Did it with $0 spent on marketing.

Relied on organic strategies only (no ads, no big spend).

They then explain the 12 free marketing channels they used.

🟢 The 12 Proven $0 Marketing Channels (explained simply)
SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

Make your website Google-friendly so people find you.

Start before launch → more time = more traffic growth.

Blog

Write helpful articles (your product story, problems solved).

Builds trust + long-term free traffic.

Medium

Publish on your own blog and on Medium.

Medium has its own readers + good Google visibility.

Landing Page

Your homepage isn’t just info — it’s a conversion machine.

Good design + clear value = more signups.

Socials

Build a founder brand (share learnings, updates).

Your personal credibility often beats paid ads.

Reviews

Collect testimonials early (on G2, Capterra, etc.).

Share them everywhere → builds trust.

Product Hunt

Launch your product on PH (and similar sites).

Relaunch with updates = more waves of new users.

Micro-Media

Get featured on small niche blogs.

Easier than trying for big media coverage.

Influencers

Build relationships with small/mid creators.

Trade favors, shoutouts → free exposure.

Communities

Be active where your audience hangs out (Reddit, Discord, Slack, LinkedIn groups).

Engage genuinely, not just promote.

Partnerships

Collaborate with similar products (newsletter swaps, guest posts).

Free audience-sharing.

Word of Mouth

Reach out personally to early users → they feel valued → they tell others.

👉 Big Idea: Instead of spending money on ads, they grew by:

Writing, sharing, and engaging.

Building relationships.

Using community platforms.

Focusing on long-term compounding traffic (SEO, blogs).
