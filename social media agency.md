
Act as my personal Website Hosting & Security Mentor. I am non-technical, with only a PC and internet. I want to set up my social media agency website (built with Cursor Pro) on a secure, scalable, SOC2-compliant host with SSO login for clients/team, auto-updates, kill switch, backups, and monitoring — all without coding. Teach me step-by-step, one action at a time, in simple language. Cover:

Domain purchase (where, how, privacy, email)
Hosting provider choice (Vercel vs Railway vs Render — which is best for me in 2025?)
SOC2 compliance — how to verify it, what to show clients
SSO setup (Auth0/Clerk/NextAuth) — how to enable, test, and document
Auto-updates + OS patching — how to ensure it’s automatic
Kill switch — how to disable site instantly if hacked
Backups — how to set up automated daily snapshots
Monitoring — UptimeRobot + Sentry — how to install, configure, get alerts
Security scans — Snyk/GitHub CodeQL — how to run them before launch
Checklist — everything I must do before launching
Use simple language. No jargon. Assume I know nothing. Be patient. Be detailed. Be practical. Be my mentor.

Start with Step 1: Domain Purchase.

I'm excited to be your Website Hosting & Security Mentor! Let's build your social media agency website together, making sure everything is secure and professional from day one. I'll guide you through each step carefully, and we won't move forward until you're completely comfortable with what we're doing.

Step 1: Domain Purchase – Getting Your Website's Address
Think of your domain name like your home address on the internet. Just as people need your street address to find your house, clients will use your domain name (like "yourcompany.com") to find your website. Let's walk through getting yours.

Understanding what you're actually buying: When you purchase a domain, you're essentially renting that name for a period of time (usually one year at a time, though you can pay for multiple years upfront). You'll need to renew it annually to keep it, just like renewing a magazine subscription.

Where to buy your domain – my recommendation for you:

I recommend Namecheap or Porkbun for someone in your position. Here's why these work well for non-technical agency owners:

Namecheap is slightly more beginner-friendly with excellent customer support available 24/7 through live chat. They have clear dashboards that don't overwhelm you with technical options. Porkbun is a bit cheaper and also very straightforward, though their support is primarily email-based.

Avoid GoDaddy – while they're well-known, they tend to upsell aggressively and their renewal prices jump significantly after the first year.

The actual purchase process (let's do this together):

First, go to Namecheap.com and type your desired business name into the search box. The system will tell you if "yourcompanyname.com" is available. If your exact name isn't available, the site will suggest alternatives like adding words (like "studio" or "agency") or using different endings like ".co" or ".agency".

For a social media agency, I strongly recommend sticking with ".com" if possible – it's what people expect and trust most. If your perfect ".com" is taken, consider adjusting your business name slightly rather than settling for less common endings.

Once you find an available domain you like, add it to your cart. The price you see (usually around ten to fifteen dollars for the first year) will increase at renewal time, often to around fifteen to twenty dollars per year. This is normal industry practice.

Privacy protection – this is crucial:

When you register a domain, your personal information (name, address, phone number, email) normally becomes publicly searchable in something called the WHOIS database. Anyone can look this up. For your privacy and safety, you absolutely want what's called "WHOIS privacy protection" or "domain privacy."

The good news is that Namecheap includes this free forever. During checkout, make sure you see "WhoisGuard" enabled (it should be automatic). This replaces your personal details with generic privacy service information in the public database.

Setting up email for your domain:

After you own "yourcompany.com," you'll want professional email addresses like "hello@yourcompany.com" or "yourname@yourcompany.com" instead of using Gmail or Yahoo. This looks far more professional to clients.

For this, I recommend Google Workspace (formerly G Suite). It costs six dollars per user per month for the basic plan, and it gives you professional Gmail using your domain name, plus Google Drive, Calendar, and Docs. The interface is exactly like regular Gmail, so there's no learning curve.

To set this up, after purchasing your domain, you'll go to workspace.google.com and start a free trial. Google will ask you to verify you own the domain by adding some special DNS records (don't worry, Google provides step-by-step instructions with screenshots). You'll log into your Namecheap account, go to your domain's settings, and copy-paste a few text entries that Google provides. This usually takes about ten minutes and connects your domain to Google's email servers.

Action items for you right now:

Before we move to Step 2, I want you to complete these specific tasks. Take your time – there's no rush:

Brainstorm three to five potential domain names for your agency. Check if they're available on Namecheap.com by typing them into the search box. Write down which ones are available and their prices. Think about which one best represents your brand and is easy for clients to remember and spell over the phone.

Once you've identified your favorite available domain, purchase it through Namecheap. During checkout, verify that WhoisGuard (privacy protection) is enabled and included. Choose to register for at least two years if you're serious about this business – this locks in the lower first-year price for another year and shows commitment.

After purchasing, you'll receive several emails from Namecheap. Keep these safe – they contain important login information and verification links. Click any verification links they send to confirm your email address.

How you'll know you succeeded:

You'll know you've completed Step 1 correctly when you can log into your Namecheap account, see your domain listed in your dashboard, and confirm that privacy protection is active (it will show a green checkmark or say "Enabled" next to WhoisGuard).

Once you've done this, come back and let me know your domain is secured. Tell me which registrar you chose and whether privacy protection is active. Then we'll move on to Step 2 where we'll choose the perfect hosting provider for your specific needs.

Take your time with this step. Getting your domain right is important because it's hard to change later. Do you have any questions about anything I've explained so far?
